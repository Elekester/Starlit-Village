### 1.4 Tournament Organizer

If necessary, the Tournament Organizer may temporarily transfer their duties to any tournamnet staff member if they are unable to fulfill them for a period of time.

### 1.5 Players

Players are responsible for:

- Behaving in a respectful manner toward tournament staff, other players, and spectators and refraining from unsporting conduct at all times.
- Complying with announced start times and time limits.
- Calling attention to any rules or policy infraction they notice in their matches.

- Accurately reporting the results of their matches in a timely manner.

If spectators believe they have observed a rules or policy violation, they are encouraged to inform tournament staff as soon as possible.



## 2 Tournament Mechanics

### 2.1 Match Structure

A match consists of a series of games that are played until one side has won a set number of games, usually two. Drawn games do not count toward this goal. If the round ends before a player has won the required number of games, the winner of the match is the player who has won the most games at that point. If both players have equal game wins, the match is a draw. Match results, not individual game results, are reported at the end of the tournament.

### 2.2 Pregame Procedures

The following steps must be performed in a timely manner before each game begins:

1. Players sit at their assigned table with their registered character.
2. Players confirm that their opponent's character name matches the name announced during matchmaking.
3. Players select any of their constructed decks and begin play.

The game is considered to have begun once all the correct players in that game have sat at their assigned table.

### 2.3 End-of-Match Procedure

Once the final game is complete, players must report their match to tournament staff.

If the match time limit is reached before a match winner is determined, players must finish the current game within 5 minutes. If the game is not completed during this period, it is considered a draw.

Once time is called, no new games should begin.

If tournament staff assigned a time extension, the end-of-match procedure does not begin until the end of the time extension.

### 2.4 Conceding or Intentionally Drawing Games or Matches

Until the result of a match has been reported, players may concede or mutually agree to draw in that game or match.

Players may not agree to a concession or draw in exchange for any reward or incentive.

If a player refuses to play, it is assumed they have conceded the match.

### 2.5 Time Extensions

If tournament staff pauses a match for more than one minute while the round clock is running, they should extend the match time appropriately.

### 2.6 Deck Construction

Players are required to have constructed their decks prior to the tournament beginning and may not alter their constructed decks throughout the tournament.

### 2.7 Dropping from a Tournament

Players may drop from a tournament at any time. If a player drops from a tournament before the first round of play has started, they are considered to have not participated in the tournament.

Players choosing to drop from a tournament must inform tournament staff before pairings for the next round are generated. If a player does not show up for their match, they will be automatically dropped from the tournament unless they report to tournament staff.

Players who have dropped may reenter a tournament at the discretion of the Tournament Organizer. Players may not drop from a tournament in exchange for or influenced by the offer of any reward or incentive.

### 2.8 Tiebreakers

The following tiebreakers are used to determine how a player ranks in a tournament:

1. Match Points
2. Median-Buchholz system (the sum of opponent's points, with the best and worst scores removed)
2. Match Wins
4. Game win percentage

A player earns 1 match points for each match win, 0 points for each match loss, and 0.5 match points for each match draw. Players receiving byes are considered to have won the match.



## 3 Tournament Violations

### 3.1 Cheating

Cheating will not be tolerated. The Tournament Organizer reviews all cheating allegations, and if they believe that a player has cheated, they will issue an approppriate penalty up to and including disqualifcation from a tournament and a loss of any prize payout.

### 3.2 Bribery

The decision to drop, concede, or a gree to an intentional draw cannot be made in exchange for or influenced by the offer of any reward or incentive, nor may any in-game decision be influenced in this manner. Making such an
offer or enticing someone into making an offer is prohibited and is considered bribery. Players may not make any offers to tournament staff in an attempt to influence the outcome of a ruling.

It is not bribery when players share prizes they have not yet received in the current tournament and they may agree to such before or during their match, as long as any such sharing does not occur in exchange for any game or match result or the dropping of a player from the tournament.

### 3.3 Wagering

Tournament staff, players, and spectators may not wager, ange, or bet on any portion of a tournament, match, or game.

### 3.4 Unsporting Conduct

Unsporting conduct will not be tolerated at any time. Unsporting conduct inclues, but is not limited to:

- Engaging in behavior that could reasonably be expected to create a feeling of being bullied or harrassed.
- Arguing with or insulting tournament staff, players, or spectators.
- Violating the personal privacy or safety of any tournament staff, player, or spectator.
- Using social media to bully, shame, or intimidate other participants.
- Failing to follow the instructions of tournament staff.

Tournament staff should investigate potential matters brought to their attention as soon as possible and take actions to discourage repeat behavior.

### 3.5 Slow Play

Players must begin their games in a timely fashyion and adhere to time limits specified for the tournament. Players must maintain a pace to allow the match to be finished in the announced time limit. Stalling is not acceptable. Players may ask tournament staff to watch their match for slow play. Such a request will be granted if feasible.

### 3.6 Outside Assisstance

During matches, players may not seek play advice from spectators and spectators may not give play advice to players.
