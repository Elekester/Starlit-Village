## 1 Tournament Fundamentals

### 1.1 Tournament Roles

The tournament includes the following roles:

- Tournament Organizer
- Tournament Staff
- Player
- Spectator

The first two roles are considered tournament staff. One individual can hold multiple roles. Anyone not part of the tournament staff is a spectator when not playing.

### 1.2 Registration

To join a Line Strike tournament, players must provide their Player ID Name and Character Name for the character they will use. They must also provide their Player ID to the tournament staff upon request.

### 1.3 Tournament Staff

Tournament staff are available to answer questions, handle rule violations, and assist with reasonable requests.

### 1.4 Tournament Organizer

The Tournament Organizer is the main authority for the tournament. All participants must follow their rulings. The Organizer can delegate their responsibilities to another staff member if needed.

### 1.5 Players

Players are expected to:

- Treat tournament staff, other players, and spectators respectfully and avoid unsporting conduct.
- Adhere to announced start times and time limits.
- Report any rule or policy infractions in their matches.
- Inform tournament staff of any discrepancies in their match records.
- Report their match results promptly.
- Know the rules in this document and any additional rules for the tournament.
- Be present for the tournament.

Players who fail to meet these responsibilities may face penalties.

### 1.6 Spectators

Spectators are anyone not fitting the above roles. They must not communicate with players during matches. If they notice rule or policy violations, they should inform the tournament staff immediately.



## 2 Tournament Mechanics

### 2.1 Match Structure

A match is a series of games where a player wins by reaching a set number of wins, usually two (2). Drawn games do not count towards this goal. If time runs out, the winner is the player with the most game wins; if tied, the match is a draw. Only match results are reported at the end of the tournament.

### 2.2 Pregame Procedures

Before each game:

1. Players stand by their assigned tables with their registered characters.
2. Players verify their opponent's name matches their assigned opponent.
3. Players sit at their assigned table, choose any of their registered decks, and begin the game.

The game is considered to have begun once all players have chosen their decks.

### 2.3 End-of-Match Procedure

After the final game, players must report the match results to the tournament staff, including the winner and the number of games won, lost, and drawn.

If time expires before a match is finished, players must complete the current game within 5 minutes. If the game is not completed in this time frame, it is a draw. No new games should start after time is called. If tournament staff has assigned a time extension to the match, it is added before the end-of-match procedure begins.

### 2.4 Conceding or Intentionally Drawing Games or Matches

Players may concede or agree to a draw any incomplete game or any match before reporting the match result, but not in exchange for any reward or incentive. Refusing to play counts as conceding the match.

### 2.5 Time Extensions

If a match is paused for over a minute, the tournament staff should extend the match time accordingly.

### 2.6 Deck Construction and Registration

Players must have their decks ready before the tournament starts and cannot change them during the tournament. They can have up to two (2) decks constructed and may use either of them for any game.

At the Tournament Organizer's discretion, you may be required to register the contents of your decks prior to the start of the tournament.

### 2.7 Dropping from a Tournament

Players can drop from the tournament anytime. If they drop before the first round, they are considered non-participants.

Players choosing to drop from a tournament must inform staff before the next round's pairings. Absence without notice results in automatic drop. Reentry is at the Organizer's discretion. Players may not drop from a tournament in exchange for or influenced by the offer of any reward or incentive.

### 2.8 Tiebreakers

The following tiebreakers are used to determine how a player ranks in a tournament:

1. Match Points
2. Median-Buchholz system (sum of opponents' points, minus the highest and lowest)
3. Match Wins
4. Game win percentage

Players earn 1 match point for a win, 0 for a loss, and 0.5 for a draw. Byes count as a win.



## 3 Tournament Violations

### 3.1 Cheating

Cheating is not tolerated. The Tournament Organizer will review allegations and issue penalties, up to disqualification and loss of prizes.

### 3.2 Bribery

Decisions to drop, concede, or draw cannot be influenced by rewards or incentives. Offering or enticing someone with such offers is bribery and prohibited. Players cannot offer anything to staff to influence rulings.

It is not bribery when players share prizes they have not yet received in the current tournament and they may agree to do so before or during their match, as long as this does not occur in exchange for any game or match result or the dropping of a player from the tournament.

### 3.3 Wagering

Staff, players, and spectators cannot bet on any part of the tournament.

### 3.4 Unsporting Conduct

Unsporting conduct is unacceptable and includes, but is not limited to:

- Bullying or harassing any participant.
- Insulting or arguing with participants.
- Violating privacy or safety of participants.
- Using social media to shame or intimidate other participants.
- Ignoring staff instructions

Tournament taff should investigate and discourage repeat behavior.

### 3.5 Slow Play

Players must start games on time and keep pace with time limits. Stalling is not acceptable. Players can ask staff to monitor for slow play. Such a request will be granted if feasible.

### 3.6 Outside Assistance

Players cannot seek or receive play advice from spectators during matches.



## 4 Tournament Organization

### 4.1 Participation Minimums

At least four (4) players must participate. If this minimum is not met, the tournament won't start, and no prizes will be awarded.

### 4.2 Number of Rounds

The tournament must have at least a number of rounds equal to $log_2(\text{number of players})$, rounded up to the nearest integer. If rounds cannot be completed, no prizes are awarded.

The number of rounds is set before the first round and cannot change.

### 4.3 Pairing Algorithm

Tournaments use the Swiss pairing algorithm unless otherwise stated.
