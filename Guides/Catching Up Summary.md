## Leveling Up



## Making N-Meseta

In the table below **Lv** refers to the minimum level required to use the method and be effective, **Boost** refers to whether or N-Meseta Earned boosts will increase the listed rate, **Player Shop** refers to whether or not the method requires access to the Personal Shop, and **Auto Sell** refers to if Auto Sell is required to achieve the rate listed.

|Method|![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour|Lv|Boost|Player Shop|Auto Sell|Notes|

|[Recurring Tasks](Catching%20Up.md#recurring-tasks)|510k - 1mil|1|❌|❌|❌|1.8mil ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/week. Takes 15 minutes to 30 minutes daily to complete.|
|[Red Boxes](Catching%20Up.md#red-boxes)|300k|1|❌|❌|❌|Red Boxes contain about 2mil ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png), obtainable once per account. Rate is a very rough estimate.|
|[Aelio Yellow Rank 2](Catching%20Up.md#aelio-yellow-rank-2)|740k - 1.5mil|25|❌|✔️|❌|You must sell a a lot of non-stackable items on the Player Shop and the quest rewards fluctuate in demand with updates. Don't expect to receive your N-meseta imediately. You also gain 8mil to 10mil EXP/hour.|
|[Retem Alnothe Rank 1](Catching%20Up.md#retem-alnothe-rank-1)|270k|40|✔️|❌|✔️|Lower ranks are better since enemies are defeated faster. Main or Sub Force, Techter, or Bouncer and use Zonde or Talis' Spread Shot to quickly defeat enemies.|
|[Geo Lab Rank 2](Catching%20Up.md#geo-lab-rank-2)|800k|70|❌|✔️|❌|Geo Lab Rank 2 can be done at level 65, but most parties will include level 70 players. Higher ranks drop better and rewards. There's a few easy Challenge Settings you can use to get the S rank.|

## Raising Your Battle Power

### Level

Every level is worth between 10 BP at low levels and 30 BP at high levels. At the level cap you'll have around 2100 BP from level alone.

### Skill Points

Skill Points earn you 3 BP per skill point spent on your Main or Subclass skill tree, so that each skill point is worth 6 BP. There is currently 47 skill points available from completing Cocoons and Towers. That's worth a total of 282 BP.

### Armor and Weapons

Armor and Weapons directly contribute to BP through their Attack and Defense stats. Each augment adds 3 to 13 BP, with around 6-8 for most budget augments.

You can also unlock a weapon's potential which grants 10 BP per level unlocked.



## Upgrading Your Gear

### Armor Upgrades

Until the endgame, use whatever armor you have. The Renaissa Armor that you receive for free is good.

Once you reach the endgame you'll either want Ajax Armor or Eclaireur Armor. Eclaireur Armor provides a slightly higher boost to potency at the cost of -5% Damage Resist. Ajax Armor has slightly more defense, provides +30 HP, +5 PP, and +1% Damage Resist. The Eclaireur Armor is technically best in slot, but both armors are good.

Make sure to augment your gear.

### Augmenting

The costs listed below are the costs to augment a single weapon or armor using one of two methods. **Method 1** uses 10 capsules per augment and an N-Augmentation Success Rate +10%. **Method 2** uses 1 capsule per augment and an N-Augmentation Success +10%. The second method has a much lower cost for the low success rate augments, but uses more N-Augmentation Success Rate items and has a much higher variance. For more details on the advantanges and disadvantages of Method 2, refer to [Optimizing Augment Capsule Use in PSO2: NGS](Augmenting.md).

#### Ultra Budget Augments
