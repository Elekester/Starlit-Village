# Main Story



## Chapter 1: Aelio Main Story

Despite having finished the Prologue, the tutorial isn't over when you get to Central City. Continue progressing the story to unlock more features.

Once you've completed the second Cocoon in **Advice from Liu Lin II** you'll  be gifted every weapon in the Renaissa Series and a complete set of Renaissa Armor. They will be much stronger than your starting equipment and will last you quite a while. You can equip any weapon useable by your main class (or your subclass once you've unlocked it).

When you learn weapon enhancement during **Advice form Rossa** make sure not to use any Renaissa weapons that you might want to try out as materials! To avoid this, you can equip or lock any item in your inventory to prevent you from accidentally losing it. If you're not sure what to do, just use a Primm weapon to enhance any of your weapons.

If you do accidentally get rid of the Renaissa weapons, other easily available weapons at this point are Primm, Tzvia, and Theseus weapons.

During **Residents of Central City** you'll need to limit break one of your weapons. The Renaissa weapons require a whopping 30 Trinite and 120,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) to limit break. Instead grab some monotite in Central Aelio and limit break a Primm weapon.

**An Abundance of Caution** will likely be the first Task that requires you to reach a certain Battle Power that you don't meet due to the Renaissa gear. Ran helpfully mentions speaking to Segreto by the Cafe, who will help you unlock your weapon's potential. You might also speak with Deeno now to learn about the Personal Shops. Even with unlocking the first level of your weapon's potential, you probably still won't have enough Battle Power. This is important. Battle Power is how NGS locks you out of content you're not ready for. In order to reach the endgame, you'll have to deal with it one way or another. At this point you have three main ways to get BP:

1. Complete Cocoons and spend skill points. The Skill Trees for all classes have abilities that increase your power or even change how a class plays. You will want to do these all eventually.
2. Level up by either completing Side Tasks and defeating enemies in Combat Zones. I really enjoyed doing the side tasks and suggest doing those as well. They also provide N-meseta that you can spend on upgrading your gear.
3. Upgrading your gear. Right now you probably won't have too much money or materials to upgrade your gear. BUT, there is an easy way to make some money available to you: Red Boxes. Scattered around each region is about 100 Red Boxes containing N-Meseta, SG, and gear. There are also 10 alpha reactors around Aelio that respawn daily for an easy 49,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png).

### Recommended Gear for Aelio
|Gear|Recommendations|
|:-|:-|
|Weapon|_Renaissa_ or Theseus Weapons|
|Armor|_Renaissa_ or Theseus Armor|
|Augments|_Boss Soul III_, _Gigas Stat II_, and _Stat IV_|

### Aelio Checklist
|Goal|Notes|
|:-|:-|
|☐&emsp;Complete the Aelio Cocoons and Towers, spending the skill points you receive.|
|☐&emsp;Have a weapon and three pieces of armor with 2 ultra budget augments on each piece.|
|☐&emsp;Achieve a Battle Power of 1100+. You can do this with the above.|
|☐&emsp;Complete Chapter 1 of the Main Story|



## Chapter 2: Retem

If you haven't already, make sure to complete the Cocoons and Towers for Aelio then spend the skill points you receive in both your main and subclass. If you have the N-Meseta make sure to augment your gear as well as fully unlocking the potential of your weapon.

**The Truth Behind the Song** and **Retem's Independent Partisan Squad** are both Story Tasks that require you to raise your BP beyond what you can achieve through Cocoons, Towers, and upgrading your gear. It's time to level! While Battledia: Yellows are very good options for leveling, I'm going to suggest doing the Side Tasks for Retem. Doing these will help you explore the region and learn more about the characters in it.

When you finish **A Happy Ending** you'll have two story quests to complete. **Retem Independent Partisan Squad** and **Mission in Kvaris**. The former unlocks the Rank 2 versions of Retem's combat zones and you'll accomplish this as you level up. The later is the proper continuation of the story and leads you into Kvaris.

### Recommended Gear for Retem
|Gear|Recommendations|
|:-|:-|
|Weapon|_Evolcoat_, _Resurgir_, _Straga_, Cattleya, Foursis, or Vialto Weapon|
|Armor|_Geant_, _Vialto\*_, _Qual De\*_, or Cattleya Armor|
|Augments|_Boss Soul III_, _Gigas Stat II_, _Stat IV_, and _Stats Dualble II_|

\* Vialto and Qual De Armor come in four variants. The base version, Arga (Melee and Ranged), Belta (Ranged and Technique), and Sheza (Melee and Technique). The non-base versions grant a potency boost in the listed weapons types.

### Retem Checklist
|Goals|
|:---|
|☐&emsp;Complete the Retem Cocoons and Towers, spending the skill points you receive.|
|☐&emsp;Have a weapon and three pieces of armor with 3 ultra budget augments on each piece.|
|☐&emsp;Achieve a Battle Power of 1474+. You can do this at around level 25 with the above goals.|
|☐&emsp;Complete Chapter 2 of the Main Story|



## Chapter 3: Kvaris

If you haven't already, make sure to complete the Cocoons and Towers for Aelio and Retem then spend the skill points you receive in both your main and subclass. If you have the N-Meseta make sure to augment your gear as well as fully unlocking the potential of your weapon.

Right off the bat, the first quest will lead you to Guiden's 10 million Exp quest. This will probably put you around levels 37 to 40 with enough BP for the 1813 BP requirement of **Mission in Kvaris**. If not, you can get to this BP in just a few levels with +30 grind Renaissa gear, but if you have the N-meseta you might instead want to upgrade some of your gear. Grab some Geant or Schwarz Armor and a Greaga, Koukloziat, or Relik weapon. Make sure to fully augment this gear. That will take around 200,000 - 250,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) to do everything.

When you get to Kvaris you'll have to reach 1898 BP to get past **On the Search**, but you can do this by upgrading your gear if you haven't and completing Kvaris' cocoons and towers. Once you reach **A Possible Lead** you'll need to reach 2049 BP. If you've reached level 40 you can upgrade your weapon to a Codeck weapon which is a massive jump in power, but those are expensive. Since you probably just upgraded your gear, lets save some N-Meseta and level up some here. You'll be able to reach the required BP at around level 42.

Just like at the end of Retem you'll have two story quests to complete. **Kvaris Independent Partisan Squad** and **A New Battle Begins**. The former unlocks the Rank 2 versions of Kvaris's combat zones and you'll accomplish this as you level up. The later is the proper continuation of the story and leads you into Stia.

### Recommended Gear for Kvaris
|Gear|Recommendations|
|:-|:-|
|Weapon|_Greaga_, _Koukloziat_, _Relik_, Fivla, Gothica, or Quintel Weapon|
|Armor|_Greas_, _Schwarz\*_, _Vijf†_, _Vios_, Vidal, Vidalun, Viosel, Defrozza‡, Defrozzis‡, Sestato‡|
|Augments|_Boss Soul III_, _Gigas Stat II_, _Stat IV_, and _Stats Dualble II_|

\* Schwarz Armor comes in three variants. Schwarzest (Melee), Schwarzgarde (Ranged), and Schwarzrosso (Technique). They grant a potency boost with the listed weapon type. <br />
† Vijf Armor comes in four variants. The base version, Arga (Melee and Ranged), Belta (Ranged and Technique), and Sheza (Melee and Technique). The non-base versions grant a potency boost with the listed weapons types. <br />
‡ This gear is not equippable until level 42. Sestato also has variants equippable at level 47.

### Kvaris Checklist
|Goal|Requirements|
|:---|:-|
|☐&emsp;Achieve a Battle Power of 1813. You can do this immediately after Guiden's quest, but you may need to upgrade your equipment or level up if not.|
|☐&emsp;Upgrade your gear or reach level 37 for **On the Search** and level 44 for **On the Search**.|
|Complete the Kvaris Cocoons and Towers, spending the skill points you receive.|
|☐&emsp;Achieve a Battle Power of 1898. You can do this after the above.|
|☐&emsp;Achieve a Battle Power of 2049. You can do this at around level 42 if you upgraded your gear or at level 40 if you upgrade to a Codeck weapon.|
|☐&emsp;Complete Chapter 3 of the Main Story|


## Chapter 4: Stia

If you haven't already, make sure to complete the Cocoons and Towers for Aelio, Retem, and Kvaris then spend the skill points you receive in both your main and subclass. If you have the N-Meseta make sure to augment your gear as well as fully unlocking the potential of your weapon.

Yet again we'll talk to our good friend Guiden for a 20 million Exp quest. This should land you around level 57 with about 2500 BP. You can get the BP for **Mission in Stia** by either leveling up to 60 or by upgrading to a Rugged or Crystia weapon. You might also upgrade your armor to Efitus armor.

Stia is a little strange. Upon entering Stia and competing the initial tasks, we don't have access to all the cocoons and towers before the next massive BP requirement in **Preparing for Battle**, only the tower in Stia Outskirts is available.

### Recommended Gear for Stia
|Gear|Recommendations|
|:-|:-|
|Weapon|_Crystia_, _Rugged_, Obsidia\*|
|Armor|_Efitus†_, Eptize\*‡|
|Augments|_Boss Soul III_, _Gigas Stat II_, _Stat IV_, _Stats Dualble II_ and _Alts Secreta II_|

\* This gear is not equippable utnil level 61. <br />
† Eptize armor comes in four variants. The base version, Arga (Melee and Ranged), Belta (Ranged and Technique), and Sheza (Melee and Technique). The non-base versions grant a potency boost with the listed weapons types. <br />
‡ Eptize comes in two variants Eptize Vida which boosts HP and Eptize Vio which boosts PP.

### Stia Checklist
|Goals|
|:---|
|☐&emsp;Upgrade your gear.|
|☐&emsp;Achieve a Battle Power of 2647. You can do this immediately if you do the above or at around level 60.|
|☐&emsp;Achieve a Battle Power of 2695.|
|☐&emsp;Achieve a Battle Power of 2878. This is the first BP requirement you can't meet with Renaissa Gear through just leveling alone.|
|☐&emsp;Complete Chapter 4 of the Main Story|

# Appendicies



## Appendix A: Raising Your Battle Power

Battle Power (BP) is the main way that NGS locks content. New areas, quests, and story progression are all behind minimum BP requirements. You can increase your Battle Power in three ways: leveling up your main class. spending skill points in both your main and subclass, and upgrading your gear.

### Level

Your level determines which equipment you can use and also provides a good boost to your BP by increasing your Base Attack and Defense stats. Every level is worth between 10 BP at low levels and 30 BP at high levels. At the level cap you'll have around 2100 BP from level alone.

See [Leveling Up](#leveling-up) for more information.

### Skill Points

Skill Points earn you 3 BP per skill point spent on your Main or Subclass skill tree, so that each skill point is worth 6 BP. There is currently 47 skill points available from completing Cocoons and Towers. That's worth a total of 282 BP.

|Region|Cocoons|Towers|Skill Points|BP|
|:-----|:-----:|:----:|:----------------:|:-:|
|Aelio|8|3|20|120|
|Retem|6|1|10|60|
|Kvaris|6|1|10|60|
|Stia|3|1|7|42|

See the [Cocoons and Towers Page on the Arks-Visiphone](https://pso2na.arks-visiphone.com/wiki/Portal:New_Genesis/Cocoons_and_Towers) for more detailed information on the cocoons and towers.

### Armor and Weapons

Armor and Weapons directly contribute to BP through their Attack and Defense stats, but a lot of your BP ll actually come from how the gear is augmented. Each augment adds 3 to 13 BP, with around 6-8 for most budget augments.

You can also unlock a weapon's potential which grants 10 BP per level unlocked.

See [Upgrading Your Gear](#upgrading-your-gear) for more information.



## Appendix B: Leveling Up

In order for a class to reach level 70, the current level cap, you need to get about 58.5 million EXP. After that every 2 million EXP grants you 1 N-EX-Cube and 10 N-Class-Cubes which allow you to further upgrade your gear and Add-on Skills.

### Main Story

Completing the Story of PSO2 NGS gives you a decent amount of EXP to start with. They're also necessary to unlock all the content in the game.

### Side Tasks

In all regions you can find the NPC Guiden, his tasks grant massive XP boosts designed to catch you up to the current content. In particular his quest, "Advice about the Quest Counter" rewards you 10 million EXP. Speeda can also be found in all regions and has a task worth 350,000 EXP that introduces you to the field races.

Yuri and Truxtun in Kvaris Camp both have relatively quick Tasks for 1 million EXP, but they won't offer them until you complete Kvaris's main story. The last task in Roald's Rookies Run Ragged Series is also worth 1 million EXP and Reso offers two tasks worth 1 million EXP each, though they're a bit long and not available until after Kvaris' main story.

|Region|Side Task EXP|EXP/hour|
|:-----|------------:|---:|
|Retem|100k - 200k|2mil|
|Kvaris|300k|6mil|
|Stia|600k - 750k|12mil|

### Daily Tasks and Leah May's Side Tasks

Completing your daily tasks will offer a moderate amount of EXP. There are two weekly Tasks with large EXP rewards for completing Leah May's Side Tasks. The amount of EXP you receive scales with level.

### Yellow Triggers and the Trooper Quests

Battledia: Yellows are the best repeatable source of EXP bar none. You get bonus experience for completing these with a party, so make sure to do so! You'll also receive Gold Primm Swords and Armor that can be sold on the Personal Shop for profit or used to enhance your own gear. The party leader must have 5 B-Trigger/Common Yellows, which can be bought for 1,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each. In exchange they receive a small boost in Exp earned.

The listed level is the level at which you can expect to be able to utilize that Battledia: Yellow.

|Battledia: Yellow|Lv|Host Exp|Party Member Exp|Exp/hour|
|:----------------|:-:|------:|---------------:|-------:|
|Aelio Troopers Rank 1|12|107k|97k|3.4mil Exp/hour|
|Retem Troopers Rank 1|21|168k|153k|-|
|Aelio Troopers Rank 2|31|295k|268k|9.4mil Exp/hour|
|Retem Troopers Rank 2|41|361k|328k|-|
|Kvaris Troopers Rank 1|51|537k|488k|-|
|Stia Troppers Rank 1|61|669k|608k|21mil Exp/hour|

### Combat Zones



## Appendix C: Upgrading Your Gear

### Weapon Upgrades

The Renaissa Weapons you received or whatever high level weapon you have will work for you until you reach the endgame. The augments on your weapon are more impactful and more costly to replace each time you upgrade.

Each weapon has a few stats that determine its usefulness: Attack Power, Variance, and Potential. Attack Power determines your maximum damage and contributes to Battle Power, variance determines the minimum and range of damage you can deal, and a Weapon's potential increases your Potency and adds additional effects. Generally speaking, most weapons before level 53 have a variance of around 75% - 100% and a max attack power of 530, while most weapons after level 53 have a variance of around 50% - 100% and a max attack power of 730. The tradeoff in variance is worth it for the massive increase in attack.

Some weapon's have an Element. They have significantly lower Base Attack in exchange for dealing extra elemental damage. This tends to mean they're a little weaker than their non elemental counterparts against most enemies, but stronger against enemies with their elemental weakness.

The current endgame is dominated by the Neos Astraean Weapons, which drop from the Battle of Halphia Lake Urgent Quest and can be obtained from the Aegis Integra Exchange Shop. Since these items are not tradeable on the Personal Shop, you must find any Fixa you want on the weapon. You can obtain enough Aegis Integra to purchase one weapon by clearing the Geometric Laboratory Rank 2 Quest once, further Aegis Integra can be obtained by trading in unwanted Neos Astraean weapons. If you wish to multiweapon a Neos Astraean weapon, it can be multiweaponed with the Neos Justitean series, just be sure to use whichever weapon whose stats you want as the base weapon.

If you can't obtain a Neos Astraean Weapon there are several alternatives you can use until you obtain one, listed below.

#### Weapon Series
|Name|Lv|Notes|
|:-|:-:|:-|
|Effulgent|60|Fire Element.|
|Tenebrous|60|Ice Element.|
|Trunkul|62|The Trunkul weapon's potency provides a massive damage resistance, making it the ideal defensive weapon.|
|Kouklophis|62|Available in the Stia Exchange Shop.|
|Gunblaze|65|-|
|Neos Justitean|70|Light Element.|
|Neos Astraean|70|Available in the Aegis Integra Exchange Shop.|

For an exhaustive list of weapons see the [Weapons Pages on the Arks-Visiphone](https://pso2na.arks-visiphone.com/wiki/Portal:New_Genesis/Swords).

### Armor Upgrades

The Renaissa Armor you received or whatever high level armor you have will work for you until you reach the endgame. The augments on your armor are more impactful and more costly to replace each time you upgrade.

There are two different paths you can take for armor upgrades. Most Armor is defensive in nature, providing small HP, PP, and potency boosts and a large defense. The Gigantix enemies of each region drop their own series of armor which trades some defense, HP, and damage resistance for more potency. The Gigantix armor is best in slot, but you should feel comfortable using other armor, as the potency difference is small.

Once you reach the endgame you'll either want Ajax Armor or Eclaireur Armor. Eclaireur Armor provides a slightly higher boost to potency at the cost of -5% Damage Resist. Ajax Armor has slightly more defense, provides +30 HP, +5 PP, and +1% Damage Resist. The Eclaireur Armor is technically best in slot, but both armors are good.

#### Common Defensive Armors
|Name|Grind|Lv|Potency|Notes|
|:---|:-:|:-:|:------|:----|
|Renaissa Armor|+30|1|+1% to all potencies|This armor is obtained for free on new accounts by progressing through the story.|
|Theseus Armor|+30|5|-|-|
|Qual De Armor Arga/Belta/Sheza|+40|12|+1% to two potencies|-|
|Vios Armor|+40|24|+1% to all potencies|-|
|Schwarzest/Schwarzgarde/Schwarzrosso Armor|+40|31|+2% to one potency|-|
|Defrozzis Armor|+40|42|+2% to all potencies|-|
|Sestato Armor Arga/Belta/Sheza|+40|47|+2.25% to two potencies|-|
|Efitus Armor Arga/Belta/Sheza|+50|57|+3% to two potencies|-|
|Eptize Armor Vida/Vio|+50|61|+3% to all potencies|Vida provides HP and Vio provides PP|
|Ajax Armor|+50|70|+3.5% to all potencies|Endgame armor.|

#### Gigantix Armors
|Name|Grind|Lv|Potency|Notes|
|:---|:-:|:-:|:------|:----|
|Geant Armor|+40|15|+2% to all potencies|-|
|Greas Armor|+40|31|+2% to all potencies|Provides more PP and defense than Geant armor at the cost of HP.|
|Behlgren Armor|+40|52|+2.75% to all potencies|-|
|Eclaireur Armor|+50|65|+4% to all potencies|Endgame armor.|

For an exhaustive list of armor see the [Units page on the Arks-Visiphone](https://pso2na.arks-visiphone.com/wiki/Portal:New_Genesis/Units).

### Item Enhancement and Limit Break

### Augmenting

As Ran says before heading to Mt. Magnus, "Battle Power is nothing more than a rough assessment." Its actually not too hard to reach the BP necessary for the endgame and still be very underpowered. How good an augment is is roughly proportional to its BP, but this is deceiving sometimes. One of the best augments in the game, Alts Secreta IV, only gives 6 BP which is equivalent to some of the worst augments in the game, the Element Ward IIIs.

As a rule of thumb, Potency is king. When deciding which augments to add to your gear, always pick the augment that increases the Stat Potency of the weapon you use. Increasing potency is a raw increase in your damage.

After potency, the next most important statistic is probably Potency Floor. You might notice that the Renaissa weapon has a Damage Adjustment of 75.0% - 100.0%. This means that each attack does between 75% and 100% of your maximum damage. Potency Floor increases the minimum, but its multiplicative. So 10% Potency Floor would mean your new minimum would be 82.5%, this means that raw Potency Floor is almost never worth getting over raw Potency. But augments that give both Potency and Potency Floor are amazing.

For your low level armor and weapons, I suggest staying as budget as possible. You can buy some really good augments in the Personal Shop for just 1,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each. The **Ultra Budget Augments** can be bought off of the Player Shop for about 1k each, making it easy to buy 40 of each and apply them to your weapons. Once you obtain your high level armor and weapons consider augmenting towards the **Budget Augments** and eventually the **Best in Slot Augments**.

The costs listed below are the costs to augment a single weapon or armor using one of two methods. **Method 1** uses 10 capsules per augment and an N-Augmentation Success Rate +10%. **Method 2** uses 1 capsule per augment and an N-Augmentation Success +10%. The second method has a much lower cost for the low success rate augments, but uses more N-Augmentation Success Rate items and has a much higher variance. For more details on the advantanges and disadvantages of Method 2, refer to [Optimizing Augment Capsule Use in PSO2: NGS](Augmenting.md).

#### Ultra Budget Augments

**Method 1 Cost:** 53k ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) <br />
**Method 2 Cost:** 27k ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) <br />
**Stats:**  +10.67% in one potency, +1.5% potency floor, some HP and PP, +32 BP <br />
**Goal:** +60% potency and +6% potency floor overall

|Melee Weapon|Ranged Weapon|Tech Weapon|
|:----|:--------|:-------|
|Melra/Meltech Dualble II or III|Melra/Ratech Dualble II or III|Meltech/Ratech Dualble II or III|
|Might IV|Precision IV|Technique IV|
|Gigas Might II or III|Gigas Precision II or III|Gigas Technique II or III|
|Daityl/Dust/Frostyl/Freid Soul III or IV|Pettas/Ragras/Crocys/Doldor Soul III or IV|Nex/Renus/Ams/Nils Soul III or IV|
|Alts Secreta II or III*|Alts Secreta II or III*|Alts Secreta II or III*|

\* If the decreased damage resistance from Alts Secreta is too big a downside for your playstyle, use Dread Keeper IV or a Dualble IV augment instead.

#### Budget Augments

**Method 1 Cost:** 1.8mil ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) <br />
**Method 2 Cost:** 860k ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) <br />
**Stats**: +13.7% in one potency, +4.0% potency floor, some HP and PP, +45 BP <br />
**Goal:** +80% potency and +17% potency floor overall

|Melee Weapon|Ranged Weapon|Tech Weapon|
|:----|:--------|:-------|
|Mastery III or IV|Mastery III or IV|Mastery III or IV|
|Might IV|Precision IV|Technique IV|
|Gigas Might IV|Gigas Precision IV| Gigas Technique IV|
|Daityl/Dust/Frostyl/Freid Soul IV|Pettas/Ragras/Crocys/Doldor Soul IV|Nex/Renus/Ams/Nils Soul IV|
|Alts Secreta IV*|Alts Secreta IV*|Alts Secreta IV*|Alts Secreta IV*|

\* If the decreased damage resistance from Alts Secreta IV is too big a downside for your playstyle, use Dread Keeper IV or a Dualble IV augment instead.

#### Best in Slot Augments

**Method 1 Cost:** 35mil ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) <br />
**Method 2 Cost:** 20mil ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) <br />
**Stats**: +15.9% in one potency, +12.5% in a second potency, +9.26% in a third potency, +8.0% potency floor, some HP and PP, +54 BP <br />
**Goal:** +100% potency and +36% potency floor overall

|Melee Weapon|Ranged Weapon|Tech Weapon|
|:----|:--------|:-------|
|Mastery IV|Mastery IV|Mastery IV|
|Halphinale|Halphinale|Halphinale|
|Addi Deftmelra/Deftmeltech|Addi Deftmelra/Deftratech|Addi Deftmeltech/Deftratech|
|Gigas Might IV or Daityl/Dust/Frostyl/Freid Soul IV|Gigas Precision IV or Pettas/Ragras/Crocys/Doldor Soul IV|Gigas Technique IV or Nex/Renus/Ams/Nils Soul IV|
|Alts Secreta IV*|Alts Secreta IV*|Alts Secreta IV*|Alts Secreta IV*|

\* If the decreased damage resistance from Alts Secreta IV is too big a downside for your playstyle, use both a Gigas augment and a Soul augment instead.

### Fixa

Weapons and Armor can sometimes be found or obtained with Preset Skills known as Fixa, which can dramatically increase the damage a weapon does, the damage reduction an armor provides, or provide skills for PP efficiency on armor. These can be transferred between items of the exact same name.

#### Weapon Fixa
|Name|Effect|
|:-|:-|
|Fixa Attack|Damage Boos|
|Fixa Fatale|Critical Hit Rate Boost|
|Fixa Termina|Critical Damage Boost|

For weapons with 75% - 100% variance, Fixa Attack is better than Fixa Fatale. For weapons with 50% - 100% variance, Fixa Fatale is better than Fixa Attack, especially once you have the Critical Damage Boosts from Fighter's Add-On Skills.

#### Armor Fixa
|Name|Effect|
|:-|:-|
|Fixa Guard|Damage Reduction|
|Fixa Performa|PP Cost Recution|
|Fixa Natura|Natural PP Recovery Boost|
|Fixa Enthusia|Active PP Recovery Boost|

Which Fixa you prefer on your weapons is going to depend a lot on your playstyle and which class you're using. For classes with poor PP management, Fixa Performa, Natura, and Enthusia will help. For classes that lack defensive abilities, Fixa Guard will be useful.

### Optimization

As you're upgrading your gear, you can use the [NGS Damage Calculator 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/195u5PhyZNLBWO0kkR7ebbcf9XARvtBS9eJbSRkiAyIk/edit#gid=0) to determine the exact outcome of making certain changes. You can calculate how different weapons, armor, augments, and fixa will affect your weapon's damage.

### Aelio Yellow Rank 2

**Rate (buying Yellow Triggers):** 740,000 to 1.4 million ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour <br />
**Rate (not buying Yellow Triggers):** 840,000 to 1.5 million ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour

**Warning:** This method requires selling a great deal of items on the Personal Shop, which is limited to 30 items at a time.

The Battledia Yellows, Aelio Troopers and Retem Troopers, both drop Gold Primm Sword +30 and Gold Primm Armor +30 as well as the Domina for that region. The sword can sell on the personal shop for 15,000 to 25,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) and the armor for 3,000 to 9,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) depending on demand. Ael Dominas sell for 13,000 to 15,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png). Meaning you can earn 27,900 to 41,700 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each run, accounting for the seller's fee on the personal shop.

If you must buy the Yellow Triggers, which cost 1,000 to 2,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each, you'll end up paying 1,250 to 2,500 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) a run if the cost is split between a party of 4. Thus you can earn 24,800 to 40,450 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) per run if you must buy the Yellow Triggers.

Aelio's Yellow Triggers can be done at a rate of 30 to 35 runs/hour with a party of 4, netting you the above rates. In adition you'll receive 8 million to 10 million experience an hour (boostable).

If Stia's Yellow Triggers get a Rank 2, expect that quest to replace Aelio's as the go to quest for this method.

### Retem Alnothe Rank 1

**Rate (not boosted):** 270,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour

Enemies drop N-Meseta and items that can be converted into N-Meseta when defeated and so Combat Zones are a valid way of making N-Meseta. Since other enemy drops aren't as valuable, its best to simply defeat low level enemies. Due to its small size and low enemy levels, Retem Alnothe is the best combat zone for this purpose. Since enemy level does not significantly affect the N-Meseta received, a low rank combat zone is actually better than a high rank combat zone, so Retem Alnothe Rank 1 is the best choice.

The general strategy is to ignore the enemy or trial markers and to spread out over the combat zone while using a class that can cast techniques as a main or subclass. Use the Zonde to defeat as many enemies as possible until a trial appears while you have 4 PSE bars at which point you defeat the trial and trigger a PSE Burst. Use either Zonde or a talis' Spread Shot mode to defeat the enemies spawned. When the boss appears, if there is a chance for a PSE Encore stay and defeat it, otherwise have one person stay to defeat it while everyone else leasves to defeat normal enemies.

This strategy is best performed with eight players that agree to use it, but it can be done in public rooms as well. If you do it in public rooms, do not expect others to follow the strategy and do not try to force others to follow the strategy.

Because of the speed at which enemies are defeated you'll need to have Auto Sell on using either Premium or an Auto Sell pass if you don't want to waste significant time clearing your interval every few minutes.

Don't forget to use any boost items like N-Meseta Earned, Triboosts, and Rappy-Shaped Fritters to increase the amount of N-Meseta earned. If you have premium a Food Boost will also grant you an N-Meseta earned boost.

You'll also earn around 1 million EXP/hour.

### Geo Lab Rank 2

**Rate (not boosted):** 800,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour

The Trinitas in Central Retem, also known as the Geometric Laboratory, has generous augment drops when you achieve A and S scores in Rank 2. The most valuable drops are the regional Domina augments, but Alts Secretas, Dread Keepers, the Gigas Stat IIIs, and the Boss Soul IVs are also worth selling. In order to achieve an S rank you need to apply some of the Challenge Settings, but you don't need to apply them all. Below are two different settings you can use to achieve an S rank. You'll be able to achieve about 20 runs an hour.

Don't forget to sell your rewards on the Personal Shop.

#### Challenge Settings

|Settings 1|Settings 2|
|:-------|:-------|
|Enemy Max HP +25%|Enemy Max HP +200%|
|Enemy Attack +300%|Enemy Attack +300%|
