## Leveling Up

In order for a class to reach level 70, the current level cap, you need to get about 58.5 million EXP. After that every 2 million EXP grants you 1 N-EX-Cube and 10 N-Class-Cubes which allow you to further upgrade your gear and Add-on Skills.

### Main Story

Completing the Story of PSO2 NGS gives you a decent amount of EXP to start with. They're also necessary to unlock all the content in the game.

### Side Tasks

In all regions you can find the NPC Guiden, his tasks grant massive XP boosts designed to catch you up to the current content. In particular his quest, "Advice about the Quest Counter" rewards you 10 million EXP. Speeda can also be found in all regions and has a task worth 350,000 EXP that introduces you to the races.

Yuri and Truxtun in Kvaris Camp both have relatively quick Tasks for 1 million EXP. The last task in Roald's Rookies Run Ragged Series is also worth 1 million EXP and Reso offers two tasks worth 1 million EXP each, though they're a bit long.

Retem City Side Tasks reward about 200,000 EXP each.
Kvaris Camp Side Tasks reward about 300,000 EXP each.
Stia Camp Side Tasks reward 600,000 or 750,000 EXP each.

### Daily Tasks and Leah May's Side Tasks

Completing your daily tasks will offer a moderate amount of EXP. There are two weekly Tasks with large EXP rewards for completing Leah May's Side Tasks. The amount of EXP you receive scales with level.

### Yellow Triggers and the Trooper Quests

Aelios can be done at a rate of 35 runs/hour.

### Combat Zones



## Making N-Meseta

In the table below **Lv** refers to the minimum level required to use the method and be effective, **Boost** refers to whether or N-Meseta Earned boosts will increase the listed rate, **Player Shop** refers to whether or not the method requires access to the Personal Shop, and **Auto Sell** refers to if Auto Sell is required to achieve the rate listed.

|Method|![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour|Lv|Boost|Player Shop|Auto Sell|Notes|
|:-----|:------------------:|:-:|:-------:|:-----------:|:-------:|:---|
|[Recurring Tasks](#recurring-tasks)|510k - 1mil|1|❌|❌|❌|1.8mil ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/week. Takes 15 minutes to 30 minutes daily to complete.|
|[Red Boxes](#red-boxes)|300k|1|❌|❌|❌|Red Boxes contain about 2mil ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png), obtainable once per account. Rate is a very rough estimate.|
|[Aelio Yellow Rank 2](#aelio-yellow-rank-2)|740k - 1.5mil|25|❌|✔️|❌|You must sell a a lot of non-stackable items on the Player Shop and the quest rewards fluctuate in demand with updates. Don't expect to receive your N-meseta imediately. You also gain 8mil to 10mil EXP/hour.|
|[Retem Alnothe Rank 1](#retem-alnothe-rank-1)|270k|40|✔️|❌|✔️|Lower ranks are better since enemies are defeated faster. Main or Sub Force, Techter, or Bouncer and use Zonde or Talis' Spread Shot to quickly defeat enemies.|
|[Geo Lab Rank 2](#geo-lab-rank-2)|800k|70|❌|✔️|❌|Geo Lab Rank 2 can be done at level 65, but most parties will include level 70 players. Higher ranks drop better and rewards. There's a few easy Challenge Settings you can use to get the S rank.|
|[Purple Triggers](#purple-triggers)||70|❌|✔️|❌||

### Recurring Tasks

**Rate:** 1.8 million ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/week (500,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour)

Each region has its own valuable gathering item you can obtain. They respawn daily and net you 104,000 N-meseta each day.

- In Central Aelio there are 14 alpha reactors. They are each worth 3,500 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png).
- In West Retem, surrounding the Sagan Mountain Road: east Ryuker, there are 10 Stellar Fragments. They are worth 2,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each.
- In Central Kvaris there are 10 Snoal. They are each worth 3,500 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png).
- At Dreisen Plant in Stia, you can find Invisible Boxes that contain rare augments and minerals.

Additionally you can complete the Weekly Tasks to receive 800,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each week and your Alliance Tasks to receive 1-5 Beta Reactors worth 100,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each. If you're in a top 10 Alliance, you'll receive 3 for a total of 300,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) from Alliance Tasks.

### Red Boxes

**Rate:** 2 million ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) once (300,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour)

Once on your account you may find Red Boxes scattered around Halpha. Each region contains over 100 of these and each one contains either 10,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png), Star Gems, or equipment. This will net you around 2 million ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png).

### Aelio Yellow Rank 2

**Rate (buying Yellow Triggers):** 740,000 to 1.4 million ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour <br />
**Rate (not buying Yellow Triggers):** 840,000 to 1.5 million ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour

**Warning:** This method requires selling a great deal of items on the Personal Shop, which is limited to 30 items at a time.

The Battledia Yellows, Aelio Troopers and Retem Troopers, both drop Gold Primm Sword +30 and Gold Primm Armor +30 as well as the Domina for that region. The sword can sell on the personal shop for 15,000 to 25,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) and the armor for 3,000 to 9,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) depending on demand. Ael Dominas sell for 13,000 to 15,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png). Meaning you can earn 27,900 to 41,700 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each run, accounting for the seller's fee on the personal shop.

If you must buy the Yellow Triggers, which cost 1,000 to 2,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each, you'll end up paying 1,250 to 2,500 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) a run if the cost is split between a party of 4. Thus you can earn 24,800 to 40,450 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) per run if you must buy the Yellow Triggers.

Aelio's Yellow Triggers can be done at a rate of 30 to 35 runs/hour with a party of 4, netting you the above rates. In adition you'll receive 8 million to 10 million experience an hour (boostable).

If Stia's Yellow Triggers get a Rank 2, expect that quest to replace Aelio's as the go to quest for this method.

### Retem Alnothe Rank 1

**Rate (not boosted):** 270,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour

Enemies drop N-Meseta and items that can be converted into N-Meseta when defeated and so Combat Zones are a valid way of making N-Meseta. Since other enemy drops aren't as valuable, its best to simply defeat low level enemies. Due to its small size and low enemy levels, Retem Alnothe is the best combat zone for this purpose. Since enemy level does not significantly affect the N-Meseta received, a low rank combat zone is actually better than a high rank combat zone, so Retem Alnothe Rank 1 is the best choice.

The general strategy is to ignore the enemy or trial markers and to spread out over the combat zone while using a class that can cast techniques as a main or subclass. Use the Zonde to defeat as many enemies as possible until a trial appears while you have 4 PSE bars at which point you defeat the trial and trigger a PSE Burst. Use either Zonde or a talis' Spread Shot mode to defeat the enemies spawned. When the boss appears, if there is a chance for a PSE Encore stay and defeat it, otherwise have one person stay to defeat it while everyone else leasves to defeat normal enemies.

This strategy is best performed with eight players that agree to use it, but it can be done in public rooms as well. If you do it in public rooms, do not expect others to follow the strategy and do not try to force others to follow the strategy.

Because of the speed at which enemies are defeated you'll need to have Auto Sell on using either Premium or an Auto Sell pass if you don't want to waste significant time clearing your interval every few minutes.

Don't forget to use any boost items like N-Meseta Earned, Triboosts, and Rappy-Shaped Fritters to increase the amount of N-Meseta earned. If you have premium a Food Boost will also grant you an N-Meseta earned boost.

You'll also earn around 1 million EXP/hour.

### Geo Lab Rank 2

**Rate (not boosted):** 800,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour

The Trinitas in Central Retem, also known as the Geometric Laboratory, has generous augment drops when you achieve A and S scores in Rank 2. The most valuable drops are the regional Domina augments, but Alts Secretas, Dread Keepers, the Gigas Stat IIIs, and the Boss Soul IVs are also worth selling. In order to achieve an S rank you need to apply some of the Challenge Settings, but you don't need to apply them all. Below are two different settings you can use to achieve an S rank. You'll be able to achieve about 20 runs an hour.

Don't forget to sell your rewards on the Personal Shop.

#### Challenge Settings

|Settings 1|Settings 2|
|:-------|:-------|
|Enemy Max HP +25%|Enemy Max HP +200%|
|Enemy Attack +300%|Enemy Attack +300%|
|Increase Restasigne Consumption: Lv. 5|Increase Restasigne Consumption: Lv. 5|
|Decreased Max Carry Limit of Signe Items: Lv. 4|Decreased Max Carry Limit of Signe Items: Lv. 4|
|-|Enemy Level Down: -10 Levels|

### Purple Triggers



## Raising Your Battle Power

Battle Power (BP) is the main way that NGS locks content. New areas, quests, and story progression are all behind minimum BP requirements. You can increase your Battle Power in three ways: leveling up your main class. spending skill points in both your main and subclass, and upgrading your gear.

### Level

Your level determines which equipment you can use and also provides a good boost to your BP by increasing your Base Attack and Defense stats. Every level is worth between 10 BP at low levels and 30 BP at high levels. At the level cap you'll have around 2100 BP from level alone.

See [Leveling Up](#leveling-up) for more information.

### Skill Points

Skill Points earn you 3 BP per skill point spent on your Main or Subclass skill tree, so that each skill point is worth 6 BP. There is currently 47 skill points available from completing Cocoons and Towers. That's worth a total of 282 BP.

### Armor and Weapons

Armor and Weapons directly contribute to BP through their Attack and Defense stats, but a lot of your BP ll actually come from how the gear is augmented. Each augment adds 3 to 13 BP, with around 6-8 for most budget augments.

You can also unlock a weapon's potential which grants 10 BP per level unlocked.

See [Upgrading Your Gear](#upgrading-your-gear) for more information.



## Upgrading Your Gear

### Armor Upgrades

The Renaissa Armor you received or whatever high level armor you have will work for you until you reach the endgame. The augments on your armor are more impactful and more costly to replace each time you upgrade.

There are two different paths you can take for armor upgrades. Most Armor is defensive in nature, providing small HP, PP, and potency boosts and a large defense. The Gigantix enemies of each region drop their own series of armor which trades some defense, HP, and damage resistance for more potency. The Gigantix armor is best in slot, but you should feel comfortable using other armor, as the potency difference is small.

Once you reach the endgame you'll either want Ajax Armor or Eclaireur Armor. Eclaireur Armor provides a slightly higher boost to potency at the cost of -5% Damage Resist. Ajax Armor has slightly more defense, provides +30 HP, +5 PP, and +1% Damage Resist. The Eclaireur Armor is technically best in slot, but both armors are good.

#### Common Defensive Armors
|Name|Lv|Potency|Notes|
|:---|:-:|:------|:----|
|Renaissa Armor|1|+1% to all potencies|This armor could last you until the endgame.|
|Qual De Armor Arga/Belta/Sheza|12|+1% to two potencies|-|
|Vios Armor|24|+1% to all potencies|-|
|Schwarzest/Schwarzgarde/Schwarzrosso Armor|31|+2% to one potency|-|
|Defrozzis Armor|42|+2% to all potencies|-|
|Sestato Armor Arga/Belta/Sheza|47|+2.25% to two potencies|-|
|Efitus Armor Arga/Belta/Sheza|57|+3% to two potencies|-|
|Eptize Armor Vida/Vio|61|+3% to all potencies|Vida provides HP and Vio provides PP|
|Ajax Armor|70|+3.5% to all potencies|Endgame armor.|

#### Gigantix Armors
|Name|Lv|Potency|Notes|
|:---|:-:|:------|:----|
|Geant Armor|15|+2% to all potencies|-|
|Greas Armor|31|+2% to all potencies|Provides more PP and defense than Geant armor at the cost of HP.|
|Behlgren Armor|52|+2.75% to all potencies|-|
|Eclaireur Armor|65|+4% to all potencies|Endgame armor.|

For an exhaustive list of armor see the [Units page on the Arks-Visiphone](https://pso2na.arks-visiphone.com/wiki/Portal:New_Genesis/Units).

### Item Enhancement and Limit Break

### Augmenting

As Ran says before heading to Mt. Magnus, "Battle Power is nothing more than a rough assessment." Its actually not too hard to reach the BP necessary for the endgame and still be very underpowered. How good an augment is is roughly proportional to its BP, but this is deceiving sometimes. One of the best augments in the game, Alts Secreta IV, only gives 6 BP which is equivalent to some of the worst augments in the game, the Element Ward IIIs.

As a rule of thumb, Potency is king. When deciding which augments to add to your gear, always pick the augment that increases the Stat Potency of the weapon you use. Increasing potency is a raw increase in your damage.

After potency, the next most important statistic is probably Potency Floor. You might notice that the Renaissa weapon has a Damage Adjustment of 75.0% - 100.0%. This means that each attack does between 75% and 100% of your maximum damage. Potency Floor increases the minimum, but its multiplicative. So 10% Potency Floor would mean your new minimum would be 82.5%, this means that raw Potency Floor is almost never worth getting over raw Potency. But augments that give both Potency and Potency Floor are amazing.

For your low level armor and weapons, I suggest staying as budget as possible. You can buy some really good augments in the Personal Shop for just 1,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each. The **Ultra Budget Augments** can be bought off of the Player Shop for about 1k each, making it easy to buy 40 of each and apply them to your weapons. Once you obtain your high level armor and weapons consider augmenting towards the **Budget Augments** or the **Best in Slot Augments**.

The costs listed below are the costs to augment a single weapon or armor using one of two methods. **Method 1** uses 10 capsules per augment and an N-Augmentation Success Rate +10%. **Method 2** uses 1 capsule per augment and an N-Augmentation Success +10%. The second method has a much lower cost for the low success rate augments, but uses more N-Augmentation Success Rate items and has a much higher variance. For more details on the advantanges and disadvantages of Method 2, refer to [Optimizing Augment Capsule Use in PSO2: NGS](Augmenting.md).

#### Ultra Budget Augments

**Method 1 Cost:** 58k ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) <br />
**Method 2 Cost:** 30k ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) <br />
**Stats:**  +10.67% in one potency, +1.5% potency floor, some HP and PP

|Melee Weapon|Ranged Weapon|Tech Weapon|

|Alts Secreta II or III*|Alts Secreta II or III*|Alts Secreta II or III*|

\* If the decreased damage resistance from Alts Secreta is too big a downside for your playstyle, use Dread Keeper IV or a Dualble IV augment instead.

#### Budget Augments

### Fixa



## Appendix A: The Tutorial and Getting Out of Aelio

Despite having finished the Prologue, the tutorial isn't over when you get to Central City. Continue progressing the story to unlock more features.

Once you've completed the second Cocoon in **Advice from Liu Lin II** you'll  be gifted every weapon in the Renaissa Series and a complete set of Renaissa Armor. They will be much stronger than your starting equipment and will last you quite a while. You can equip any weapon useable by your main class (or your subclass once you've unlocked it).

When you learn weapon enhancement during **Advice form Rossa** make sure not to use any Renaissa weapons that you might want to try out as materials! To avoid this, you can equip or lock any item in your inventory to prevent you from accidentally losing it. If you're not sure what to do, just use a Primm weapon to enhance any of your weapons.

If you do accidentally get rid of the Renaissa weapons, other easily available weapons at this point are Primm, Tzvia, and Theseus weapons.

During **Residents of Central City** you'll need to limit break one of your weapons. The Renaissa weapons require a whopping 30 Trinite and 120,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) to limit break. Instead grab some monotite in Central Aelio and limit break a Primm weapon.

**An Abundance of Caution** will likely be the first Task that requires you to reach a certain Battle Power that you don't meet due to the Renaissa gear. Ran helpfully mentions speaking to Segreto by the Cafe, who will help you unlock your weapon's potential. You might also speak with Deeno now to learn about the Personal Shops. Even with unlocking the first level of your weapon's potential, you probably still won't have enough Battle Power. This is important. Battle Power is how NGS locks you out of content you're not ready for. In order to reach the endgame, you'll have to deal with it one way or another. At this point you have three main ways to get BP:

1. Complete Cocoons and spend skill points. The Skill Trees for all classes have abilities that increase your power or even change how a class plays. You will want to do these all eventually.
2. Level up by either completing Side Tasks and defeating enemies in Combat Zones. I really enjoyed doing the side tasks and suggest doing those as well. They also provide N-meseta that you can spend on upgrading your gear.
3. Upgrading your gear. Right now you probably won't have too much money or materials to upgrade your gear. BUT, there is an easy way to make some money available to you: Red Boxes. Scattered around each region is about 100 Red Boxes containing N-Meseta, SG, and gear. There are also 10 alpha reactors around Aelio that respawn daily for an easy 49,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png).
