# Main Story

In order to progress through the story you'll need to meet certain Battle Power (BP) requirements. The three main ways you'll increase your BP during the story are (click the link to jump to that section of the guide):

1. [Completing cocoons and spending skill points](#skill-points) from the region you're in and previous regions.
2. [Upgrading your weapon and armor](#Appendix-C-Upgrading-Your-Gear) with the recommended gear for your region.
3. [Leveling up](#Appendix-B-Leveling-Up).

[^BPReq]: The recommended gear will help, but don't feel like you need to grab it if you don't have the N-meseta to fully enhance and augment it. You can [level up](#Appendix-B-Leveling-Up) or make [N-Meseta](#Appendix-D-Making-N-Meseta) to get you to your goals instead.

## Chapter 1: Aelio Main Story

If you've just beaten the Prologue and our joining us in Aelio, let me be the first to welcome you to NGS. Don't fret if you haven't unlocked everything yet, as you progress through this first chapter of the story you'll gain access to more features.

### Aelio Tasks Summary

|Task|BP|Recommendation|
|:-|-:|:-|
|**The First Mission**|830|Equip the Renaissa Gear you receive from Liu Lin.|
|**Preparing for Battle**|950|Complete the Aelio Cocoons and Towers.|
|**An Abundance of Caution**|1100+|Augment your Renaissa gear, but only enough to meet the requirements if you plan on upgrading in Retem.|

<img src="/Images/Map_Aelio.png" alt="Aelio Map" width="33%" align="right">

Once you've completed the second Cocoon in **Advice from Liu Lin II** you'll  be gifted every weapon in the Renaissa Series and a complete set of Renaissa Armor. You can equip any weapon useable by your main class (or your subclass once you've unlocked it). During **Advice form Rossa** you'll learn about weapon enhancement. If you don't want to accidentally use any items as materials you can lock them in your inventory.

During **Residents of Central City** you'll need to limit break one of your weapons. The Renaissa weapons will be too expensive to limit break. Instead grab some monotite in Central Aelio from the mountains or the river and limit break a Primm weapon.

**An Abundance of Caution** will likely be the first Task that requires you to reach a certain Battle Power (BP) that you don't meet. Battle Power is how NGS locks you out of content you're not ready for. Ran helpfully mentions speaking to Segreto by the Cafe, who will help you unlock your weapon's potential. You might also speak with Deeno now to learn about the Personal Shops.

### Aelio Gear Recommendations[^BPReq]

|Gear|Recommendations|
|:-|:-|
|Weapon|Renaissa, Trois De, or Theseus Weapons|
|Armor|Renaissa or Theseus Armor|
|Augments|Boss Soul III, Gigas Stat II, and Stat IV|



## Chapter 2: Retem

If you haven't already, make sure to complete the Cocoons and Towers for Aelio. Then spend the skill points you receive in both your main and subclass. If you have the N-Meseta and augment capsules make sure to augment your gear as well as unlocking the potential of your weapon.

### Retem Tasks Summary

|Task|BP|Recommendation|
|:-|-:|:-|
|**The Cornesrstone of Retem's Revival**|1243+|Get Retem Gear OR fully augment your Renaissa gear.|
|**The Truth Behind the Song**|1474+|Complete the Retem Cocoons and Towers. Get to level 17 with Retem Gear or level 21 with Renaissa gear.|

<img src="/Images/Map_Retem.png" alt="Retem Map" width="33%" align="right">

**The Truth Behind the Song** requires you to raise your BP beyond what you can achieve through Cocoons, Towers, and upgrading your gear. It's time to level! While Battledia: Yellows are very good options for leveling, I'm going to suggest doing the Side Tasks for Retem. Doing these will help you explore the region and learn more about the characters in it.

When you finish **A Happy Ending** you'll have two story quests to complete. **Retem Independent Partisan Squad** and **Mission in Kvaris**. The former unlocks the Rank 2 versions of Retem's combat zones and you'll accomplish this as you level up. The later is the proper continuation of the story and leads you into Kvaris.

### Retem Gear Recommendations[^BPReq]

|Gear|Recommendations|
|:-|:-|
|Weapon|Evolcoat, Resurgir, Straga, Cattleya, Foursis, or Vialto Weapon|
|Armor|Geant, Vialto\*, Qual De\*, or Cattleya Armor|
|Augments|Boss Soul III, Gigas Stat II, Stat IV, and Stats Dualble II|

\* Vialto and Qual De Armor come in four variants. The base version, Arga (Melee and Ranged), Belta (Ranged and Technique), and Sheza (Melee and Technique). The non-base versions grant a potency boost in the listed weapons types.



## Chapter 3: Kvaris

If you haven't already, make sure to complete the Cocoons and Towers for Aelio and Retem. Then spend the skill points you receive in both your main and subclass. If you have the N-Meseta and augment capsules make sure to augment your gear as well as unlocking the potential of your weapon.

### Kvaris Tasks Summary

|Task|BP|Recommendation|
|:-|-:|:-|
|**Mission in Kvaris**|1813+|Complete Guiden's Task. Get Kvaris Gear or level 40 with Renaissa Gear.|
|**On the Search**|1898+|Complete the Kvaris Cocoons and Towers. Get  Kvaris Gear or level 41 with Renaissa Gear.|
|**A Possible Lead**|2049+|Get to level 42 with Kvaris Gear or level 47 with Renaissa Gear.|

<img src="/Images/Map_Kvaris.png" alt="Kvaris Map" width="33%" align="right">

Right off the bat, the first quest will lead you to Guiden's 10 million Exp quest. This will get you to between level 36 to 38 with enough BP for the 1813 BP requirement of **Mission in Kvaris** if you have at least Retem gear. If not, you can get to this BP in just a few levels. At this level you'll have access to [Aelio Yellow Rank 2](#yellow-triggers-and-the-trooper-quests) for quick leveling.

Once you reach **A Possible Lead** you'll need to reach 2049 BP. If you've reached level 40 you can upgrade your weapon to a Codeck weapon which is a massive jump in power, but those are expensive and I don't recommend it. Save some N-Meseta and level up some here.

Just like at the end of Retem, once you've completed Chapter 2 you'll have two story quests to complete. **Kvaris Independent Partisan Squad** and **A New Battle Begins**. The former unlocks the Rank 2 versions of Kvaris's combat zones and you'll accomplish this as you level up. The later is the proper continuation of the story and leads you into Stia.

### Kvaris Gear Recommendations[^BPReq]

|Gear|Recommendations|
|:-|:-|
|Weapon|Greaga, Koukloziat, Relik, Fivla, Gothica, or Quintel Weapon|
|Armor|Greas, Schwarz\*, Vijf†, Vios, Vidal, Vidalun, Viosel, Defrozza‡, Defrozzis‡, Sestato‡|
|Augments|Boss Soul III, Gigas Stat II, Stat IV, and Stats Dualble II|

\* Schwarz Armor comes in three variants. Schwarzest (Melee), Schwarzgarde (Ranged), and Schwarzrosso (Technique). They grant a potency boost with the listed weapon type. <br />
† Vijf Armor comes in four variants. The base version, Arga (Melee and Ranged), Belta (Ranged and Technique), and Sheza (Melee and Technique). The non-base versions grant a potency boost with the listed weapons types. <br />
‡ This gear is not equippable until level 42. Sestato also has variants equippable at level 47.



## Chapter 4: Stia

If you haven't already, make sure to complete the Cocoons and Towers for Aelio, Retem, and Kvaris. Then spend the skill points you receive in both your main and subclass. If you have the N-Meseta and augment capsules make sure to augment your gear as well as unlocking the potential of your weapon.

### Stia Tasks Summary

|Task|BP|Recommendation|
|:-|-:|:-|
|**Mission in Stia**|2647+|Complete Guiden's Task. Get a Crystia or Rugged Weapon at least Qual De Armor or level 68 with Renaissa Gear.|
|**Preparing for Battle**|2695+|Complete the Stia Ouskirts Tower.|
|**The Battle of Alterra Base**|2788+|Complete the the Cocoons in Mediola Outer Area 2 and Dreisen Plant. Get to level 58 with Stia Gear or level 70 with Renaissa Gear.
|**Preparing for More Battle**|2878+|Complete the Stia Cocoons and Towers. Get to level 61 with Stia Gear or level 64 with a Crystia or Rugged Weapon and at least Renaissa Armor.|

<img src="/Images/Map_Stia.png" alt="Stia Map" width="33%" align="right">

Yet again we'll talk to our good friend Guiden for a 20 million Exp quest. This should land you between level 57 and level 60. You can get the BP for **Mission in Stia** by either leveling up or by upgrading just your weapon to a Crystia or Rugged Weapon. Feel free to upgrade your armor now as well. If you've been using Renaissa Gear, you'll be forced to upgrade at least your weapon in Stia.

Stia is a little strange. Unlike the other regions where you unlock the exploration regions all at once, you won't have access them and the cocoons they contain before the next BP requirement in **Preparing for Battle**. Only the tower in Stia Outskirts is available. Prior to the quest in **The Battle of Alterra Base** you'll be able to complete the Cocoons in Mediola Outer Area 2 and Dreisen Plant. The final cocoon will have to wait until after **Preparing for More Battle**.

### Stia Gear Recommendations[^BPReq]
|Gear|Recommendations|
|:-|:-|
|Weapon|Crystia, Rugged, or Obsidia\* Weapon|
|Armor|Efitus† or Eptize\*‡ Armor|
|Augments|Boss Soul III, Gigas Stat II, Stat IV, Stats Dualble II and Alts Secreta II|

\* This gear is not equippable utnil level 61. <br />
† Eptize armor comes in four variants. The base version, Arga (Melee and Ranged), Belta (Ranged and Technique), and Sheza (Melee and Technique). The non-base versions grant a potency boost with the listed weapons types. <br />
‡ Eptize comes in two variants Eptize Vida which boosts HP and Eptize Vio which boosts PP.



## Chapter 5: Leciel

If you haven't already, make sure to complete the Cocoons and Towers for Aelio, Retem, Kvaris, and Stia. Then spend the skill points you receive in both your main and subclass. If you have the N-Meseta and augment capsules make sure to augment your gear as well as unlocking the potential of your weapon.

There are no additional Battle Power requirements in Chapter 5. Enjoy the story and discover the secret of Leciel!



# Postgame

## The Endgame

Congratulations, you've beaten the Main Story of PSO2: NGS! If you haven't already, make sure to complete the Cocoons and Towers. Then spend the skill points you receive in both your main and subclass. If you have the N-Meseta and augment capsules make sure to augment your gear as well as fully unlocking the potential of your weapon.

### Endgame Content
|Content|BP|Notes|
|:-|-:|:-|
|[Level 70](#Appendix-B-Leveling-Up)|-|You should try to reach level 70 first. The fastest way to do this is by completing [Yellow Stias](#Yellow-Triggers-and-the-Trooper-Quests) with a party of 4.|
|[Add-On Skills](#appendix-e-add-on-skills)|-|Once a class reaches level 70, getting another 2mil Exp in that class rewards you with 10 N-Class-Cubes which can be exchanged for Add-On Skills at the Class Counter. See [Appendix E](#appendix-e-add-on-skills).|
|[Geo Lab Rank 2](#geo-lab-rank-2)|2878+|Most people running this are doing so in parties of 4 to achieve S-Rank. You'll want to be at least level 66 if anyone in your party is level 70 and they're not running the decreased enemy level modifier.|
|[Purple Aelio, Retem, and Kvaris Rank 3](#purple-triggers)|2972+|Defeat all the regional bosses to receive valuable drops. You'll need to be at least level 64 with Stia gear to do these. Consider also beginning to augment any Endgame Gear with [Budget Augments](#budget-augments).|
|Urgent Quest: The Battle of Halphia Lake|3119+|Its time to defeat Dark Falz! Maybe? Make sure to follow the Blight Round marker if there's a ranger in the party. If you're the ranger, make sure to use blight rounds frequently. Especially on the pillars in phase 1, where the extra damage and coordination can lead to an early win in that phase. In phase 2, make sure to keep up your DPS through the DPS checks, otherwise Falz might wipe the party. The final DPS check can be dodged even when failed by running to the edge of the arena.|
|[Purple Stia Rank 1](#purple-triggers)|3227+|Defeat all the Stia bosses to receive valuable drops. You'll need to be level 70 with endgame gear to do these.|

<img src="/Images/Geo_Lab.png" width="50%" align="right">

Many players in the endgame will be level 70 with at least +80% potency if not +100% potency on their favorite weapon. Some, especially in pickup games without Alliance members, will expect everyone else to do the same and might complain if you don't. While you should be working on upgrading your gear, if you are harassed for the gear you have equipped, please report the offending players. If you ask the League for help with endgame content, our members will help you out without any expectations of your gear.

In order to best support your party you will want to get to level 70 and get as good of gear as you can. For leveling, [Yellow Stias](#Yellow-Triggers-and-the-Trooper-Quests) will be your bread and butter. Get a party of 4 Alliance members and you'll be at level 70 in no time.

Neos Astraean is the Best in Slot weapon against all enemies except Light Enemies, where Neos Justiean beats it out. Astraean only drops from The Battle of Halphia Lake Urgent Quest, but you can obtain them from the Aegis Exchange Shop for 5 Aegis Integra. You can get 5 Integra for completing Geo Lab Rank 2 once with the modifiers that make it easy soloable. More Integra can be obtained through drops from the Urgent Quest or by trading in unwanted Astraean weapons.

Eclaireur Armor is the Best in Slot armor, though it makes you into a glass cannon. If you prefer to have some defense use Ajax Armor instead. Both give healthy potency boosts and are affordable.

For augments, you'll want to start working towards the [Budget Augments](#budget-augments). It's perfectly fine to use some [Ultra Budget Augments](#ultra-budget-augments) or augments you own as replacements for expensive augments like Mastery IV.

### Endgame Gear Recommendations
|Gear|Recommendations|
|:-|:-|
|Weapon|Neos Astraean, Neos Justitean\*, or Gunblaze Weapon|
|Armor|Ajax, Eclaireur, Efitus†, or Eptize‡ Armor|
|Augments|[Budget Augments](#budget-augments) or [Best in Slot Augments](#best-in-slot-augments)|

\* Neos Justitean is a Light element weapon. It is the strongest weapon against enemies weak to light, but otherwise weaker than other Neos Astraean. It's still stronger than Gunblaze. <br />
† Eptize armor comes in four variants. The base version, Arga (Melee and Ranged), Belta (Ranged and Technique), and Sheza (Melee and Technique). The non-base versions grant a potency boost with the listed weapons types. <br />
‡ Eptize comes in two variants Eptize Vida which boosts HP and Eptize Vio which boosts PP.



## Update Preparation

<img src="/Images/Slayer_Promo.png" width="50%" align="right">

On April 5th, Chapter 5 of the story will be released. Please make sure to enjoy it! At the same time the Slayer Operation Exchange Shop will open. There will be two Gunblade camos available, a few Almati camos, and a host of pre-augmented Gunblade weapons with Fixa Attack 1. The Trunkul and Tenebrous weapons can be good holdovers until you get your hands on an Augmented Neos Astraean Gunblade.

If you did all the Slayer Operations Prep Limited-Time Tasks you'll have 20 Tickets to spend. I suggest picking up the Arms Refiner IIs, any camos you want, a weapon to keep if you plan on playing Slayer while leveling it, and spending the rest on weapons to sell on the player shop. Check out the [Get ready for the Slayer! Campaign](https://pso2.com/players/news/slayer_20230301/) for a full list of rewards.

Presumably the Aegis Integra Exchange Shop will be updated either on April 5th or on April 12th with the Neos Astraean Gunblade. For this reason you should have 5 Aegis Integra and enough capsules to affix [Ranged Budget Augments](#budget-augments) to the weapon.

Whether you grab A Neos Astraean Gunblade, a Trunkul Gunblade, or are sticking to another class you'll also be able to unlock your weapon's potential to level 5 using N-Ex Cubes, so make sure you have a few saved up.

On April 19th the NGS 2nd Anniversary Event will begin. New 8-Star Revita weapons will be available in the Event Shop with augments, potential 5, and +51 grind (meaning its already limit broken). Make sure to earn Seasonal Points by defeating mobs in Retem Alnothe!

A new type of quest, Duel Quests, will become available in which you must defeat bosses solo. New augments will be available that increase your weapon's potency by a massive amount only in these quests.

You'll also be able to unlock your weapon's potential to level 6 using Photon Chunk IIA and IIBs, which drop from Limited-Time Emergency Quest: Happy Rappy Rumble and later the LTQ and high Rank Urgent Quests.

# Appendicies

## Appendix A: Raising Your Battle Power

<img src="/Images/NPC_Creston.png" width="25%" align="right">

Battle Power (BP) is the main way that NGS locks content. New areas, quests, and story progression are all behind minimum BP requirements. You can increase your Battle Power in three ways: leveling up your main class, spending skill points in both your main and subclass, and upgrading your gear.

### Level

Your level determines which equipment you can use and also provides a good boost to your BP by increasing your Base Attack and Defense stats. Every level is worth between 10 BP at low levels and 30 BP at high levels. At the level cap you'll have around 2100 BP from level alone.

See [Appendix B: Leveling Up](#Appendix-B-Leveling-Up).

### Skill Points

Skill Points earn you 3 BP per skill point spent on your Main or Subclass skill tree, so that each skill point is worth 6 BP. There is currently 47 skill points available from completing Cocoons and Towers. That's worth a total of 282 BP.

|Region|Cocoons|Towers|Skill Points|BP|
|:-----|:-----:|:----:|:----------------:|:-:|
|Aelio|8|3|20|120|
|Retem|6|1|10|60|
|Kvaris|6|1|10|60|
|Stia|3|1|7|42|

See the [Cocoons and Towers Page on the Arks-Visiphone](https://pso2na.arks-visiphone.com/wiki/Portal:New_Genesis/Cocoons_and_Towers).

### Armor and Weapons

Armor and Weapons directly contribute to BP through their Attack and Defense stats, which can be increased by enhancing and limit breaking them. You also get BP from how the gear is augmented. Each augment adds 3 to 13 BP, with around 6-8 for most budget augments. You can also unlock a weapon's potential which grants 10 BP per level unlocked.

See [Sppendix C: Upgrading Your Gear](#Appendix-C-Upgrading-Your-Gear).



## Appendix B: Leveling Up

<img src="/Images/Aelio_Yellow.png" width="50%" align="right">

In order for a class to reach level 70, the current level cap, you need to get about 58.5 million EXP. After that every 2 million EXP grants you 1 N-EX-Cube and 10 N-Ex-Class-Cubes which allow you to further upgrade your gear and generate Add-on Skills.

### Side Tasks

NPCs in all the cities and camps offer Side Tasks that reward you with N-Meseta, Materials, and EXP.

Most Side Tasks offer similar EXP based on the region you find the NPC in, but there are a few notable exceptions. Yuri, Truxtun, and Reso in Kvaris Camp both have relatively quick Tasks for 1 million EXP, but they won't offer them until you complete Kvaris's main story. The last task in Roald's Rookies Run Ragged Series is also worth 1 million EXP. Speeda can be found in all regions and has a task worth 350,000 EXP that introduces you to the field races.

|Region|Side Task EXP|EXP/hour|
|:-----|------------:|---:|
|Retem|100k - 200k|2mil|
|Kvaris|300k|6mil|
|Stia|600k - 750k|12mil|

### Daily Tasks and Leah May's Side Tasks

Completing your daily tasks will offer a moderate amount of EXP. There are two weekly Tasks with large EXP rewards for completing Leah May's Side Tasks. The amount of EXP you receive scales with level.

### Yellow Triggers and the Trooper Quests

Battledia: Yellows are the best repeatable source of EXP bar none. You get bonus experience for completing these with a party, so make sure to do so! You'll also receive Gold Primm Swords and Armor that can be sold on the Personal Shop for profit or used to enhance your own gear. The party leader must have 5 B-Trigger/Common Yellows, which can be bought for 1,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each on the Personal shop. In exchange the leader receives a small boost in Exp earned.

You can increase this experience by using boost items like Triboosts, Rappy Fritters, and N-Exp-Earned. This can significantly increase your experience rate.

The listed level is the level at which you can expect to be able to utilize that Battledia: Yellow.

|Battledia: Yellow|Lv|Host Exp|Party Member Exp|Runs/hour|Exp/hour|
|:----------------|:-:|------:|---------------:|:-:|-------:|
|Aelio Troopers Rank 1|12|107k|97k|34|3.3mil|
|Retem Troopers Rank 1|21|168k|153k|24|3.7mil|
|Aelio Troopers Rank 2|31|295k|268k|34|9.1mil|
|Retem Troopers Rank 2|41|361k|328k|24|7.9mil|
|Kvaris Troopers Rank 1|51|537k|488k|20|9.8mil|
|Stia Troppers Rank 1|61|669k|608k|40|24.3mil|


### Combat Zones

You can gain experience in combat zones by defeating mobs and completing trials. You'll gain reduced experience if the enemies are above or below your level, so its best to stick to zones near to your level. That said, Retem Alnothe is so cramped that it makes it possible to use it for leveling well beyond its level by defeating enemies in one hit.

The general method in combat zones is to follow the E and T markers and defeat enemies to increase your PSE Bar. Once you have 4 bars completing a T trial will usually trigger a PSE Burst, causing many emeies to spawn in close proximity. In smaller combat zones there is a faster method you can use if those in the room agree to it. Instead of following the markers, everyone should spread out and use the Zonde technique or Talis' Spread Shot PA to defeat all enemies until you have 4 bars with an active T trial, guaranteeing a PSE burst when it is completed.



## Appendix C: Upgrading Your Gear

Upgrading your gear will give you a potentially massive boost in BP, attack power, and defense power. In general upgrade your weapon before your armor, as a significant portion of an armor's effectiveness comes from its augments, whereas a significant part of a weapon's effectiveness comes from its Attack Power and Potential.

### Weapon Upgrades

<img src="/Images/NPC_Lavona.png" width="25%" align="right">

Each weapon has a three stats that determine its usefulness: Attack Power, Variance, and Potential. Attack Power determines your maximum damage, variance determines the minimum and range of damage you can deal, and a Weapon's potential increases your Potency and adds additional effects. Generally speaking, most weapons before level 53 have a variance of around 75% - 100%, while most weapons after level 53 have a variance of around 50% - 100%. The tradeoff in variance is worth it for the massive increase in attack that these weapons provide.

Every weapon also has a natural enhancement limit. Low level weapons can only be enhanced up to +40 without having to be limit broken, while high level weapons can be enhanced up to +50 without being limit broken.

Some weapon's have an Element. They have significantly lower Base Attack in exchange for dealing extra elemental damage. This tends to mean they're a little weaker than their non elemental counterparts against most enemies, but stronger against enemies with their elemental weakness.

The current endgame is dominated by the Neos Astraean weapons, which drop from the Battle of Halphia Lake Urgent Quest and can be obtained from the Aegis Integra Exchange Shop. Since these items are not tradeable on the Personal Shop, you must find any Fixa you want on the weapon. You can obtain enough Aegis Integra to purchase one weapon by clearing the Geometric Labyrinth Rank 2 Quest once. Further Aegis Integra can be obtained by trading in unwanted Neos Astraean weapons. If you wish to multiweapon a Neos Astraean weapon, it can be multiweaponed with the Neos Justitean series, just be sure to use whichever weapon whose stats you want as the base weapon.

#### Weapons
|Lv|Natural Limit|Attack at Limit|Weapon Series|
|:-:|-:|-:|:-|
|1-10|+30|255|Trois De, Renaissa|
|11-20|+40|280|Cattleya, Evolcoat, Foursis, Resurgir, Straga, Vialto|
|21-39|+40|320|Fivla, Gothica, Greaga, Koukloziat, Quintel, Relik|
|40-54|+40|435|Codeck, Sechetyl|
|55-64|+50|670|Crystia, Effulgent, Obsidia, Rugged, Tenebrous, Trunkul|
|65-70|+50|690|Gunblaze, Neos Astraean, Neos Justitean|

For an exhaustive list of weapons see the [Weapons Pages on the Arks-Visiphone](https://pso2na.arks-visiphone.com/wiki/Portal:New_Genesis/Swords).

### Armor Upgrades

<img src="/Images/NPC_Greif.png" width="25%" align="right">

There are two different paths you can take for armor upgrades. Most Armor is defensive in nature, providing small HP, PP, small potency boosts and a large defense. The Gigantix enemies of each region drop their own series of armor which trades some defense, HP, and damage resistance for more potency. The Gigantix armor is best in slot, but you should feel comfortable using other armor, as the potency difference is small.

Like weapons, armor also has natural enhancement limits, making higher level armor better without having to limit break.

Once you reach the endgame you'll either want Ajax Armor or Eclaireur Armor. Eclaireur Armor provides a slightly higher boost to potency at the cost of -5% Damage Resist. Ajax Armor has more defense, provides +30 HP, +5 PP, and +1% Damage Resist. The Eclaireur Armor is technically best in slot, but both armors are good.

Since roughly half the BP armor grants comes from its augments, it is usually the last thing upgraded.

|Lv|Natural Limit|Defense at Limit|Armor Series|
|:-:|-:|-:|:-|
|1-9|+30|40|Theseus, Trois De, Renaissa|
|10-14|+40|55|Cattleya, Qual De, Vialto|
|15-56|+40|60|Behlgren, Defrozza, Defrozzis, Geant, Greas, Schwarz, Sestato, Vidal, Vidalun, Vijf, Vios, Viosel|
|57-70|+50|90|Ajax, Eclaireur, Efitus, Eptize|

### Item Enhancement and Limit Break

<img src="/Images/NPC_Gernsback.png" width="25%" align="right">

Weapons and Armor can be enhanced to improve their attack and defense as well as increase the number of augment slots, using other gear as materials for this enhancement. Silver and gold primm gear give an extra boost to enhancement, so you should always use those. Enhanced gold primm gear drops from Yellow Triggers and gives the most enhancement experience per N-Meseta spent. Gold Primm Sword+30 is best for weapons and Gold Primm Armor+20 is best for armor.

Most gear has a natural enhancement limit, which varies from item to item. Generally, higher level and higher rarity equipment has a higher natural limit, though every item can be Limit Breaked to go past this. Limit Breaking costs 100k to 200k ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) along with additional materials. Due to the N-Meseta cost, its not worth limit breaking low level gear. Instead you should just upgrade to higher level gear with a higher natural limit.

Endgame gear must be limit broken to reach its highest enhancement. To fully limit break a weapon you'll need Arms Refiners and Arms Refiner IIs. Arms Refiners can be made from Strugments, which drop in combat zones and can be bought off the player shop. Arms Refiner IIs drop from Neusen Plant and presumably later combat zones as well.

In the below table, # Gold Primm states the number of Gold Primm items needed to enhance an item from +0 to the Limit.

#### Enhancement and Limit Break Information

|Limit|# Gold Primm+20|# Gold Primm+30|Limit Break Cost|

|30|4|2|120k ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) and 30x Trinite|

### Augmenting

<img src="/Images/NPC_Nozomi.png" width="25%" align="right">

As Ran says before you went to Mt. Magnus, "Battle Power is nothing more than a rough assessment." Its actually not too hard to reach the BP necessary for the endgame and still be very underpowered. Augments are what make you stronger. Generally, good augments grant good BP, but this is deceiving sometimes. One of the best augments in the game, Alts Secreta IV, only gives 6 BP which is equivalent to some of the worst augments in the game, the Element Ward IIIs.

As a rule of thumb, Potency is king since it increases the damage you do. When deciding which augments to add to your gear, pick the augment that increases the Stat Potency of the weapon you use.

After potency, the next most important statistic is probably Potency Floor. You might notice that the Renaissa weapon has a Damage Adjustment of 75.0% - 100.0%. This means that each attack does between 75% and 100% of your maximum damage. Potency Floor increases the minimum, but it' multiplicative. So 10% Potency Floor would mean your new minimum would be 82.5%, this means that raw Potency Floor is almost never worth getting over raw Potency.

Augments that give both Potency and Potency Floor are usually Best in Slot.

For your low level armor and weapons, I suggest staying as budget as possible. You can buy some really good augments in the Personal Shop for just 1,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each or just use the augments you've naturally collected by playing the game.

**Ultra Budget Augments** can be bought off of the Player Shop for about 1k each, making it easy to buy 40 of each and apply them to your weapons. Once you obtain your high level armor and weapons consider augmenting towards the **Budget Augments** and eventually the **Best in Slot Augments**. You don't have to augment all at once, so feel free to upgrade one augment at a time.

The costs listed below are the costs to augment a single weapon or armor using one of two methods. **Method 1** uses 10 capsules per augment and an N-Augmentation Success Rate +10%. **Method 2** uses 1 capsule per augment and an N-Augmentation Success +10%. The second method has a much lower cost for the low success rate augments, but uses more N-Augmentation Success Rate items and has a much higher variance. For more details on the advantanges and disadvantages of Method 2, refer to [Optimizing Augment Capsule Use in PSO2: NGS](Augmenting.md).

The augments are separated into three categories for Melee Weapons, Ranged Weapons, or Tech Weapons. You could make a universal potency build. Using Eradi/Vardi/Aegis Soul IV, Stira Domina IV, and Triplble to replace single or double stat augments.

#### Ultra Budget Augments

**Method 1 Cost:** 53k ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) <br />
**Method 2 Cost:** 27k ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) <br />
**Stats:**  +10.67% in one potency, +1.5% potency floor, some HP and PP, +32 BP <br />
**Goal:** +60% potency and +6% potency floor overall

|Melee Weapon\*|Ranged Weapon\*|Tech Weapon\*|
|:----|:--------|:-------|
|Melra/Meltech Dualble II or III|Melra/Ratech Dualble II or III|Meltech/Ratech Dualble II or III|
|Might IV|Precision IV|Technique IV|
|Gigas Might II or III|Gigas Precision II or III|Gigas Technique II or III|
|Daityl/Dust/Frostyl/Freid Soul III or IV|Pettas/Ragras/Crocys/Doldor Soul III or IV|Nex/Renus/Ams/Nils Soul III or IV|
|Alts Secreta II or III†|Alts Secreta II or III†|Alts Secreta II or III†|

\* Remember, the cheapest augments are the ones you already own. Feel free to replace any of the above augments with augments you own as long as they provide the appropriate potency and/or potency floor. <br />
† If the decreased damage resistance from Alts Secreta is too big a downside for your playstyle, use Dread Keeper instead.

#### Budget Augments

**Method 1 Cost:** 800k ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) <br />
**Method 2 Cost:** 400k ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) <br />
**Stats**: +14.5% in one potency, +2.5% potency floor, some HP and PP, +45 BP <br />
**Goal:** +90% potency and +10% potency floor overall

|Melee Weapon|Ranged Weapon|Tech Weapon|
|:----|:--------|:-------|
|Stira Domina*|Stira Domina*|Stira Domina*|
|Might IV|Precision IV|Technique IV|
|Gigas Might III|Gigas Precision III| Gigas Technique III|
|Daityl/Dust/Frostyl/Freid Soul IV|Pettas/Ragras/Crocys/Doldor Soul IV|Nex/Renus/Ams/Nils Soul IV|
|Alts Secreta IV*|Alts Secreta IV*|Alts Secreta IV*|Alts Secreta IV*|

\* If the decreased damage resistance from Stira Domina and Alts Secreta IV is too big a downside for your playstyle, use Melra/Meltech/Ratech Dualble IV, Mastery III or Dread Keeper IV instead.

#### Best in Slot Augments

**Method 1 Cost:** 35mil ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) <br />
**Method 2 Cost:** 20mil ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) <br />
**Stats**: +15.9% in one potency, decent secondary and tertiary potencies, +8.5% potency floor, some HP and PP, +54 BP <br />
**Goal:** +100% potency and +38% potency floor overall

|Melee Weapon|Ranged Weapon|Tech Weapon|
|:----|:--------|:-------|
|Mastery IV|Mastery IV|Mastery IV|
|Halphinale|Halphinale|Halphinale|
|Addi Deftmelra/Deftmeltech|Addi Deftmelra/Deftratech|Addi Deftmeltech/Deftratech|
|Gigas Might IV or Daityl/Dust/Frostyl/Freid Soul IV|Gigas Precision IV or Pettas/Ragras/Crocys/Doldor Soul IV|Gigas Technique IV or Nex/Renus/Ams/Nils Soul IV|
|Alts Secreta IV*|Alts Secreta IV*|Alts Secreta IV*|Alts Secreta IV*|

\* If the decreased damage resistance from Alts Secreta IV is too big a downside for your playstyle, use both a Gigas augment and a Soul augment instead.

### Weapon Potential

Every weapon has a unique potential that can be unlocked at the Item Lab. The costs and effects vary from weapon to weapon, but generally cost a great deal of minerals, and 10k to 250k ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each level. Unlocking the Level 4 and 5 potentials will require 5 N-Ex-Cubes and 120k to 320k ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each.

### Fixa

<img src="/Images/NPC_Lydia.png" width="25%" align="right">

Weapons and Armor can sometimes be found or obtained with Preset Skills known as Fixa, which can dramatically increase the damage a weapon does, the damage reduction an armor provides, or provide skills for PP efficiency on armor. These can be transferred between items of the exact same name.

#### Weapon Fixa
|Name|Effect|
|:-|:-|
|Fixa Attack|Damage Boos|
|Fixa Fatale|Critical Hit Rate Boost|
|Fixa Termina|Critical Damage Boost|

For weapons with 75% - 100% variance, Fixa Attack is better than Fixa Fatale. For weapons with 50% - 100% variance, Fixa Fatale is better than Fixa Attack, especially once you have the Critical Damage Boosts from Fighter's Add-On Skills.

#### Armor Fixa
|Name|Effect|
|:-|:-|
|Fixa Guard|Damage Reduction|
|Fixa Performa|PP Cost Recution|
|Fixa Natura|Natural PP Recovery Boost|
|Fixa Enthusia|Active PP Recovery Boost|

Which Fixa you prefer on your weapons is going to depend a lot on your playstyle and which class you're using. For classes with poor PP management, Fixa Performa, Natura, and Enthusia will help. For classes that lack defensive abilities, Fixa Guard will be useful.

### Optimization

As you're upgrading your gear, you can use the [NGS Damage Calculator 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/195u5PhyZNLBWO0kkR7ebbcf9XARvtBS9eJbSRkiAyIk/edit#gid=0) to determine the exact outcome of making certain changes. You can calculate how different weapons, armor, augments, and fixa will affect your weapon's damage.



## Appendix D: Making N-Meseta

In the table below **Boost** refers to whether or N-Meseta Earned boosts will increase the listed rate, **Player Shop** refers to whether or not the method requires access to the Personal Shop, and **Auto Sell** refers to if Auto Sell is required to achieve the rate listed.

|Method|![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour|Lv|Boost|Player Shop|Auto Sell|Notes|
|:-----|------------------:|:-:|:-------:|:-----------:|:-------:|:---|
|[Recurring Tasks](#recurring-tasks)|600k - 1.2mil|1|❌|❌|❌|2.2mil ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/week. Takes 15 minutes to 30 minutes daily to complete.|

### Recurring Tasks

**Rate:** 2.2 million ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/week (600,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour)

Each region has its own valuable gathering item you can obtain. They respawn daily and net you 104,000 N-meseta each day. The linked images for each region mark the location you may find the items with treasure chests.

- In [Central Aelio](/Images/Map_Aelio.png) there are 14 alpha reactors. They are each worth 3,500 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png).
- In [West Retem](/Images/Map_Retem.png), surrounding the Sagan Mountain Road: east Ryuker, there are 10 Stellar Fragments. They are worth 2,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each.
- In [Central Kvaris](/Images/Map_Kvaris.png) there are 10 Snoal. They are each worth 3,500 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png).
- At Dreisen Plant in Stia, you can find Invisible Boxes that contain rare augments and minerals.

Additionally you can complete the Daily Tasks to receive 134,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) daily, the Weekly Tasks to receive 200,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each week and your Alliance Tasks to receive 1-5 Beta Reactors worth 100,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each. If you're in a top 10 Alliance, you'll receive 3 for a total of 300,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) from Alliance Tasks.

### Red Boxes

**Rate:** 2 million ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) once (300,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour)

Once on your account you may find Red Boxes scattered around Halpha. Each region contains over 100 of these and each one contains either 10,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png), Star Gems, or equipment. This will net you around 2 million ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png).

### Aelio Yellow Rank 2

**Rate:** 740,000 to 1.5 million ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour

**Warning:** This method requires selling a great deal of non-stackable items on the Personal Shop.

The Battledia Yellows, Aelio Troopers and Retem Troopers, both drop Gold Primm Sword +30 and Gold Primm Armor +30 as well as the Domina for that region. In Aelio Yellow Rank 2 you can earn 24,800 to 40,450 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png) each run, accounting for the cost of Yellow Triggers and the seller's fee on the personal shop.

In adition you'll receive boostable experience for running these triggers.

### Retem Alnothe Rank 1

**Rate (not boosted):** 270,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour

You can make N-Meseta in combat zones by converting any items you find into N-Meseta and selling rare drops. Since most enemy drops aren't as valuable, its best to simply defeat low level enemies. Due to its small size and low enemy levels, Retem Alnothe is the best combat zone for this purpose. A low rank combat zone is actually better than a high rank combat zone, since you can defeat enemies faster, so Retem Alnothe Rank 1 is the best choice.

The general strategy is to ignore the enemy or trial markers and to spread out over the combat zone. Use the Zonde technique or Talis' Spread Shot PA to defeat as many enemies as possible until a trial appears while you have 4 PSE bars. At that point you defeat the trial and trigger a PSE Burst. When the boss appears, if there is a chance for a PSE Encore stay and defeat it, otherwise have one person stay to defeat it while everyone else leasves to defeat normal enemies.

This strategy is best performed with eight players that agree to use it, but it can be done in public rooms as well. If you do it in public rooms, do not expect others to follow the strategy and do not try to force others to follow the strategy.

Because of the speed at which enemies are defeated you'll need to have Auto Sell on using either Premium or an Auto Sell pass if you don't want to waste significant time clearing your interval every few minutes. Don't forget to use any boost items like N-Meseta Earned, Triboosts, and Rappy-Shaped Fritters to increase the amount of N-Meseta earned. If you have premium a Food Boost will also grant you an N-Meseta earned boost.

You'll also earn around 1mil EXP/hour.

### Purple Triggers

**Rate:** - ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour

The Battledia: Purple Devastators quests can be profitable with drops like gigas augments, soul augments, and rare motions that can be sold on the Player Shop. At the moment, Aelio Rank 2+ has the most valuable motion drop. For augments you must run Aelio/Retem Purple Rank 3, Kvaris Purple Rank 2+, or Stia Purple in order to have a chance at obtaining Gigas Stat IV.

### Geo Lab Rank 2

**Rate:** 800,000 ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png)/hour

The Trinitas in Central Retem, also known as the Geometric Labyrinth or just Geo Lab, has generous augment drops when you achieve A and S scores in Rank 2. The most valuable drops are the regional Domina augments, but Alts Secretas, Dread Keepers, the Gigas Stat IIIs, and the Boss Soul IVs are also worth selling. In order to achieve an S rank you need to apply some of the Challenge Settings, but you don't need to apply them all. Below are two different settings you can use to achieve an S rank. You'll be able to achieve about 20 runs an hour.

#### Challenge Settings

|Settings 1|Settings 2|
|:-------|:-------|
|Enemy Max HP +25%|Enemy Max HP +200%|
|Enemy Attack +300%|Enemy Attack +300%|
|Increase Restasigne Consumption: Lv. 5|Increase Restasigne Consumption: Lv. 5|
|Decreased Max Carry Limit of Signe Items: Lv. 4|Decreased Max Carry Limit of Signe Items: Lv. 4|
|-|Enemy Level Down: -10 Levels|



## Appendix E: Add-On Skills

<img src="/Images/Add-On_skills.png" width="50%" align="right">

Add-On Skills increase your characters stats without affecting your gear or class. To generate an Add-On Skill, simply use the Class Counter and spend N-Class-Ex-Cubes (which are obtained by overleveling your class or as drops from Cannonball Strike) to generate Add-On Skills. You'll get that class's main effect and two random sub-effects, all with random levels from 1 to 20. The main effect will never decrease in level while the sub-effects can.

You'll have the option (once you unlock them) to spend 1 cube and 5k to 50k ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png). Spending more N-Meseta raises the lowest roll possible from 1 to 10. This is almost never worth it, since it doesn't increase the odds of getting high rolls, so save your money and just spend the 5k ![N-Meseta](/Images/NGSUIMSTIcon.png).

Each class has a unique main effect and four potential sub-effects: a unique sub-effect, HP/PP Recovery upon Joining Trial, Status Resistance Up, and HP Up. The best sub-effects are the unique sub-effect and HP Up, try to get these for each class.

A good goal is to get level 18 or higher in the main effect and a decent level in the desired sub-effects of every class. You can go for level 20 in an effect, but I've found that takes nearly 1,000 class cubes on average.

### Notable Add-On Skills
|Class|Add-On Skill|
|:-|:-|
|Hunter|Melee Weapon Potency Up|
|Fighter|Critical Hit Potency Up|
|Ranger|Ranged Weapon Potency Up|
|Force|Technique Weapon Potency Up|
|Techter|Damage Resistance Up|
|Braver|Critical Hit Rate Up|
|Bouncer|Dash and Glide PP Recovery|
