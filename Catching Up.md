# Raising Your Battle Power

Battle Power (BP) is the main way that NGS locks content. New areas, quests, and story progression are all behind minimum BP requirements. You can increase your Battle Power in three ways: leveling up your main class. spending skill points in both your main and subclass, and upgrading your gear.

## Level

Your level determines which equipment you can use and also provides a good boost to your BP. Every level is worth between 10 BP at low levels and 30 BP at high levels.

See the section (Leveling Up)[#Leveling Up] for more information.

## Skill Points

Skill Points earn you 3 BP per skill point spent on your Main and Subclass skill tree.

## Armor and Weapons

As Ran says before heading to Mt. Magnus, "Battle Power is nothing more than a rough assessment." Its actually not too hard to reach the BP necessary for the endgame and still be very underpowered. Armor and Weapons directly contribute to BP through their Attack and Defense stats, but most of your power will actually come from how the gear is augmented.

See the section # Upgrading Gear for more information.

### Item Enhancement and Limit Break

### Add Augments

Each augment adds 3 to 13 BP, with around 6-8 for most budget augments. How good an augment is is roughly proportional to its BP, but this is deceiving sometimes. One of the best augments in the game, Alts Secreta IV, only gives 6 BP which is equivalent to some of the worst augments in the game, the Element Ward IIIs.

See the section ## Augmenting for more information.

### Unlock Potential

Unlocking a weapon's potential grants 10 BP per level and typically a massive Potency Bonus.



# Leveling Up

## Main Story

Completing the Story of PSO2 NGS gives you a decent amount of EXP to level up with.

## Side Tasks

In all regions you can find the NPC Guiden, his tasks grant massive XP boosts designed to catch you up to the current content. In particular his quest, "Advice about the Quest Counter" rewards you 10 million EXP. Speeda can also be found in all regions and has a task worth 350,000 EXP that introduces you to the races.

Yuri and Truxtun in Kvaris Camp both have relatively quick Tasks for 1 million EXP. The last task in Roald's Rookies Run Ragged Series is also worth 1 million EXP and Reso offers two tasks worth 1 million EXP each, though they're a bit long.

Retem City Side Tasks reward about 200,000 EXP each.
Kvaris Camp Side Tasks reward about 300,000 EXP each.
Stia Camp Side Tasks reward 600,000 or 750,000 EXP each.

There are two Weekly Tasks for completing Leah May's Side Tasks (which reset daily). The amount of EXP you receive scales with level.

## Daily Tasks and Leah May's Side Tasks

Completing your daily tasks will offer a moderate amount of EXP. There are two weekly Tasks with large EXP rewards for completing Leah May's Side Tasks. The amount of EXP you receive scales with level.



# Making N-Meseta

## Daily Gathering and Weekly Tasks

Each region has its own valuable gathering item you can obtain. They respawn daily and net you 104,000 N-meseta each day.

- In Central Aelio there are 14 alpha reactors. They are each worth 3,500 N-meseta.
- In West Retem, surrounding the Sagan Mountain Road: east Ryuker, there are 10 Stellar Fragments. They are worth 2,000 N-meseta each.
- In Central Kvaris there are 10 Snoal. They are each worth 3,500 N-meseta.
- At Dreisen Plant in Stia, you can find Invisible Boxes that contain rare augments and minerals.

Additionally you can complete the Weekly Tasks to receive 800,000 N-meseta each week.

If you do your daily gathering and Weekly Tasks you'll net a little more than 1.5 million N-meseta each week.

## Red Boxes

Once on your account you may find Red Boxes scattered around Halpha. Each region contains over 100 of these and each one contains either 10,000 N-meseta, Star Gems, or equipment. This will net you around 2 million N-meseta.

## Getting New Gear

## Item Enhancement and Limit Break

## Augmenting

As a rule of thumb, Potency is king. When deciding which augments to add to your gear, always pick the augment that increases the Stat Potency of the weapon you use. Increasing potency is a raw increase in your damage.

After potency, the next most important statistic is probably Potency Floor. You might notice that the Renaissa weapon has a Damage Adjustment of 75.0% - 100.0%. This means that each attack does between 75% and 100% of your maximum damage. Potency Floor increases the minimum, but its multiplicative. So 10% Potency Floor would mean your new minimum would be 82.5%, this means that Potency Floor is almost never worth getting over raw Potency. But augments that give both Potency and Potency Floor are amazing.

For your low level armor and weapons, I suggest staying as budget as possible. You can buy some really good augments in the Personal Shop for just 1,000 N-meseta each. The below augments can be bought off of the Player Shop for about 1k each, making it easy to buy 40 of each and apply them to your weapons.

Stat IV
Boss Soul III or Boss Soul IV
Gigas Stat II or Gigas Stat III
Alts Secreta II or Alts Secreta III
Triplble, Stat Dualble II or III

# Appendix A: The Tutorial and Getting Out of Aelio

Despite having finished the Prologue, the tutorial isn't over when you get to Central City. Continue progressing the story to unlock more features.

Once you've completed the second Cocoon in "Advice from Liu Lin II" you'll  be gifted every weapon in the Renaissa Series and a complete set of Renaissa Armor. They will be much stronger than your starting equipment and will last you quite a while. You can equip any weapon useable by your main class (or your subclass once you've unlocked it).

When you learn weapon enhancement during "Advice form Rossa" make sure not to use any Renaissa weapons that you might want to try out as materials! To avoid this, you can equip or lock any item in your inventory to prevent you from accidentally losing it. If you're not sure what to do, just use a Primm weapon to enhance any of your weapons.

If you do accidentally get rid of the Renaissa weapons, other easily available weapons at this point are Primm, Tzvia, and Theseus weapons.

During "Residents of Central City" you'll need to limit break one of your weapons. The Renaissa weapons require a whopping 30 Trinite and 120,000 N-meseta to limit break. Instead grab some monotite in Central Aelio and limit break a Primm weapon.

"An Abundance of Caution" will likely be the first Task that requires you to reach a certain Battle Power that you don't meet due to the Renaissa gear. Ran helpfully mentions speaking to Segreto by the Cafe, who will help you unlock your weapon's potential. You might also speak with Deeno now to learn about the Personal Shops. Even with unlocking the first level of your weapon's potential, you probably still won't have enough Battle Power. This is important. Battle Power is how NGS locks you out of content you're not ready for. In order to reach the endgame, you'll have to deal with it one way or another. At this point you have three main ways to get BP:

1. Complete Cocoons and spend skill points. The Skill Trees for all classes have abilities that increase your power or even change how a class plays. You will want to do these all eventually.
2. Level up by either completing Side Tasks and defeating enemies in Combat Zones. I really enjoyed doing the side tasks and suggest doing those as well. They also provide N-meseta that you can spend on upgrading your gear.
3. Upgrading your gear. Right now you probably won't have too much money or materials to upgrade your gear. BUT, there is an easy way to make some money available to you: Red Boxes. Scattered around each region is about 100 Red Boxes containing N-Meseta, SG, and gear. There are also 10 alpha reactors around Aelio that respawn daily for an easy 49,000 N-meseta.
